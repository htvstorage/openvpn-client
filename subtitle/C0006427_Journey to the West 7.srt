1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:19,602
Sun Wukong put his hand on the iron pillar.

2
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,768
He felt it move.

3
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:26,686
"Hmm," he thought. "This piece of iron really is magical.

4
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:29,724
I bet it will do whatever I want it to do."

5
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:32,643
"Smaller!" commanded Wukong.

6
00:00:32,644 --> 00:00:34,554
The pillar shrank!

7
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:40,429
Soon it was just a little taller than Wukong.

8
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,045
He picked it up and swung it around.

9
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:49,384
"This is a perfect weapon for me," he said.

10
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:53,770
"I can't believe he can lift it!" said the Dragon Queen.

11
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:57,126
Wukong made the bar even smaller.

12
00:00:57,127 --> 00:01:00,247
Soon it was no bigger than a pin.

13
00:01:00,248 --> 00:01:05,646
He placed it inside his ear.

14
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:09,893
"I've got what I want," said Wukong. "Good-bye."

15
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:14,878
He turned around and left.

16
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,035
"He was very rude," said the Dragon Queen.

17
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:22,120
The Dragon King clenched his fists.

18
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:29,540
"I'm going to report him to the Jade Emperor!"

19
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:35,305
Back home, the others were amazed by Wukong's new weapon.

20
00:01:35,306 --> 00:01:40,018
"Nobody will ever attack us again!" declared Wukong.

21
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,723
The monkeys and apes cheered.

22
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:50,638
They held a big feast that lasted until late at night.

23
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:55,788
Wukong went to bed happy.

24
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:00,788
But as he fell asleep, two spirits grabbed him.

25
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:03,544
"What are you doing?" asked Wukong.

26
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:11,475
"Let go of me!"

27
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:17,116
He kicked and struggled as the spirits dragged him out of his cave.

28
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:20,217
They walked toward a dark and creepy city.

29
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:25,874
A sign on the entrance gate said "Land of Darkness."

30
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:29,239
"The Land of Darkness?" cried Wukong.

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,017
"That's where people go when they die.

32
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:36,805
I'm supposed to live forever!"

33
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:39,510
He yanked his arms free.

34
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:41,903
"Grow!" he cried.

35
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:45,448
His iron bar quickly grew.

36
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:50,303
Whap! He knocked out the first spirit.

37
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:55,213
Crack! He knocked out the second spirit.

38
00:02:55,214 --> 00:03:00,396
Wukong stomped into the Land of Darkness.

39
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:05,348
He headed toward the Palace of Darkness.

40
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,022
As he went, he swung his iron bar back and forth.

41
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,764
Demons and ghosts fled.

42
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:18,009
A tall spirit stepped out of the palace.

43
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,679
"What's going on out here?" the spirit asked.

44
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,450
"Who are you?" asked Wukong.

45
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:28,405
"I am the Judge of the Dead," said the spirit.

46
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:31,851
"Why are you causing all this trouble?"

47
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:35,514
"I want to know why I was brought here," said Wukong.

48
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,444
"Tell me now!"

49
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:40,003
The judge held up his hands.

50
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:45,081
"If you were brought here, it means your time on Earth is over."

51
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:50,186
"Nonsense!" yelled Wukong. "I'm going to live forever!"

52
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:52,550
The judge looked nervous.

53
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:55,492
"Let's check the Directory," he said.

54
00:03:55,493 --> 00:04:00,743
"The Directory contains the name and age of every creature on Earth.

55
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:05,317
It says when each creature will die."

56
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:09,882
Inside the palace the judge opened a large book.

57
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,844
"What is your name?" he asked.

58
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:14,879
Wukong told him.

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,514
The judge flipped through the pages.

60
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:19,904
"Here it is," said the judge.

61
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:22,777
"It says 'Sun Wukong.

62
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:29,466
Born from a stone three hundred years ago. Died today.'"

63
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:31,485
Wukong shook his head.

64
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:34,699
"No. I'm going to live forever."

65
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,950
"The Directory isn't wrong," said the judge.

66
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:43,261
"You'll have to stay here now."

67
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:47,610
Wukong raised his iron bar and glared at the judge.

68
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:50,238
"Give me that book!"

69
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,987
The judge hesitated.

70
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:54,027
"I can't give it toâ€”"

71
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:56,779
"Now!" said Wukong.

72
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:02,697
Shaking, the judge handed the book to Wukong.

73
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:06,309
Wukong plucked two of his hairs and blew on them.

74
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,562
They turned into a brush and a jar of ink.

75
00:05:10,563 --> 00:05:14,061
He drew a line through his name.

76
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:17,478
"You can't do that!" said the judge.

77
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,729
"Yes, I can," said Wukong.

78
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:28,241
Next, Wukong found the names of all the other monkeys and apes.

79
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:34,077
He crossed out their names too.

80
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:38,200
"Now I really will live forever," said Wukong.

81
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:44,326
"And so will all of my subjects!"
