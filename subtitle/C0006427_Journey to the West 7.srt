[g@Sun Wukong put his hand on the iron pillar.

2
231:33:31,266.6670000553131 --> 291:41:51,266.6670000553131
He felt it move.@g]

3
291:43:31,266.6670000553131 --> 428:18:31,266.6670000553131
"Hmm," he thought. "This piece of iron really is magical.

4
428:20:11,266.6670000553131 --> 512:41:51,266.6670000553131
I bet it will do whatever I want it to do."

5
512:43:31,266.6670000553131 --> 593:46:51,266.6670000553131
"Smaller!" commanded Wukong.

6
593:48:31,266.6670000553131 --> 646:51:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The pillar shrank!

7
646:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 810:03:31,266.66699981689453
Soon it was just a little taller than Wukong.@g]

8
810:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 938:16:51,266.66699981689453
He picked it up and swung it around.

9
938:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1058:48:31,266.66699981689453
"This is a perfect weapon for me," he said.

10
1058:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1180:38:31,266.66699981689453
"I can't believe he can lift it!" said the Dragon Queen.

11
1180:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1273:51:51,266.66699981689453
Wukong made the bar even smaller.

12
1273:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1360:33:31,266.66699981689453
[g@Soon it was no bigger than a pin.

13
1360:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1510:31:51,266.66699981689453
He placed it inside his ear.@g]

14
1510:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1628:30:11,266.66699981689453
"I've got what I want," said Wukong. "Good-bye."

15
1628:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1766:58:31,266.66699981689453
He turned around and left.

16
1767:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1882:26:51,266.66699981689453
"He was very rude," said the Dragon Queen.

17
1882:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1968:08:31,266.66699981689453
The Dragon King clenched his fists.

18
1968:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2174:15:11,266.66699981689453
"I'm going to report him to the Jade Emperor!"

19
2174:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2334:23:31,266.66699981689453
Back home, the others were amazed by Wukong's new weapon.

20
2334:25:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2465:18:31,266.66699981689453
"Nobody will ever attack us again!" declared Wukong.

21
2465:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2540:26:51,266.66699981689453
The monkeys and apes cheered.

22
2540:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2760:18:31,266.66699981689453
They held a big feast that lasted until late at night.

23
2760:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2903:21:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Wukong went to bed happy.

24
2903:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3042:15:11,266.66699981689453
But as he fell asleep, two spirits grabbed him.@g]

25
3042:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3118:48:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"What are you doing?" asked Wukong.

26
3118:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3339:06:51,266.66699981689453
"Let go of me!"@g]

27
3339:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3495:48:31,266.66699981689453
He kicked and struggled as the spirits dragged him out of his cave.

28
3495:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3581:56:51,266.66699981689453
They walked toward a dark and creepy city.

29
3581:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3739:05:11,266.66699981689453
A sign on the entrance gate said "Land of Darkness."

30
3739:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3832:33:31,266.66699981689453
"The Land of Darkness?" cried Wukong.

31
3832:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3909:43:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"That's where people go when they die.

32
3909:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4042:43:31,266.66699981689453
I'm supposed to live forever!"@g]

33
4042:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4117:51:51,266.66699981689453
[g@He yanked his arms free.

34
4117:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4184:20:11,266.66699981689453
"Grow!" he cried.@g]

35
4184:21:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4282:48:31,266.66699981689453
[g@His iron bar quickly grew.

36
4282:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4417:40:11,266.66699981689453
[i@Whap!@i] He knocked out the first spirit.@g]

37
4417:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4554:03:31,266.66699981689453
[i@Crack!@i] He knocked out the second spirit.

38
4554:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4698:01:51,266.66699981689453
Wukong stomped into the Land of Darkness.

39
4698:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4835:35:11,266.66699981689453
He headed toward the Palace of Darkness.

40
4835:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4965:25:11,266.66699981689453
[g@As he went, he swung his iron bar back and forth.

41
4965:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5069:21:51,266.66699981689453
Demons and ghosts fled.@g]

42
5069:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5187:16:51,266.66699981689453
A tall spirit stepped out of the palace.

43
5187:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5289:13:31,266.66699981689453
"What's going on out here?" the spirit asked.

44
5289:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5366:11:51,266.66699981689453
"Who are you?" asked Wukong.

45
5366:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5476:03:31,266.66699981689453
"I am the Judge of the Dead," said the spirit.

46
5476:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5571:46:51,266.66699981689453
"Why are you causing all this trouble?"

47
5571:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5673:31:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"I want to know why I was brought here," said Wukong.

48
5673:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5727:08:31,266.66699981689453
"Tell me now!"@g]

5727:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5798:13:31,266.66699981689453
The judge held up his hands.

50
5798:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5939:16:51,266.66699981689453
"If you were brought here, it means your time on Earth is over."

51
5939:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6081:05:11,266.66699981689453
"Nonsense!" yelled Wukong. "I'm going to live forever!"

52
6081:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6146:45:11,266.66699981689453
[g@The judge looked nervous.

53
6146:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6228:28:31,266.66699981689453
"Let's check the Directory," he said.@g]

54
6228:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6374:20:11,266.66699981689453
"The Directory contains the name and age of every creature on Earth.

6374:21:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6501:23:31,266.66699981689453
It says when each creature will die."

56
6501:25:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6628:11:51,266.66699981689453
Inside the palace the judge opened a large book.

57
6628:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6710:28:31,266.66699981689453
"What is your name?" he asked.

58
6710:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6767:00:11,266.66699981689453
[g@Wukong told him.

59
6767:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6840:11:51,266.66699981689453
The judge flipped through the pages.@g]

6906:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6986:23:31,266.66699981689453
"It says 'Sun Wukong.@g]

Born from a stone three hundred years ago. Died today.'"

7172:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7228:16:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Wukong shook his head.

7228:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7317:33:31,266.66699981689453
"No. I'm going to live forever."@g]

7317:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7407:51:51,266.66699981689453
"The Directory isn't wrong," said the judge.

66
7407:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7555:23:31,266.66699981689453
"You'll have to stay here now."

67
7555:25:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7676:11:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Wukong raised his iron bar and glared at the judge.

68
7676:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7749:11:51,266.66699981689453
"Give me that book!"@g]

7749:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7797:46:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The judge hesitated.

7797:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7854:26:51,266.66699981689453
"I can't give it toâ€”"@g]

7854:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7930:53:31,266.66699981689453
"Now!" said Wukong.

72
7930:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8095:16:51,266.66699981689453
Shaking, the judge handed the book to Wukong.

73
8095:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8195:36:51,266.66699981689453
Wukong plucked two of his hairs and blew on them.

74
8195:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8313:45:11,266.66699981689453
[g@They turned into a brush and a jar of ink.

75
8313:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 8410:56:51,266.66699981689453
He drew a line through his name.@g]

8410:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8505:51:51,266.66699981689453
"You can't do that!" said the judge.

77
8505:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8596:10:11,266.66699981689453
"Yes, I can," said Wukong.

8596:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 8804:50:11,266.66699981689453
Next, Wukong found the names of all the other monkeys and apes.

79
8804:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 8966:56:51,266.66699981689453
He crossed out their names too.

80
8966:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 9081:28:31,266.66699981689453
"Now I really will live forever," said Wukong.

81
9081:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 9251:38:31,266.66699981689453
"And so will all of my subjects!"
