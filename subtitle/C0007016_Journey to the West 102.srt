176:36:50,933.3329999446869 --> 356:08:30,933.3329999446869
With tears in her eyes, she told the judge that she had lied the day before.

356:10:10,933.3329999446869 --> 449:25:10,933.3329999446869
"The Tang Monk and his companions are innocent."

8
710:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 846:51:50,933.3330001831055

846:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 902:41:50,933.3330001831055
Lady Kou gasped.

1221:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1456:26:50,933.3330001831055

1456:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1628:30:10,933.3330001831055
"I'm glad to be out of there," said Wujing.

15
1628:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1724:53:30,933.3330001831055

18
1898:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2005:50:10,933.3330001831055
"I framed you for killing my husband," she said.

19
2005:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2050:48:30,933.3330001831055

2829:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2931:46:50,933.3330001831055

2931:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3022:11:50,933.3330001831055
Lady Kou and the judge were shocked.

3022:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3127:50:10,933.3330001831055
"Can you really do that?" asked Lady Kou.

33
3127:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3179:00:10,933.3330001831055

3226:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3338:40:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong brought the king of the Black Rooster Kingdom back to life."

36
3338:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3391:45:10,933.3330001831055
He turned to the monkey.

37
3391:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3466:15:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"The sage Laozi helped you that time.

3466:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3527:00:10,933.3330001831055
Will you ask him for help again?"@g]

39
3527:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3588:18:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"No," said Wukong.

40
3588:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3657:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Laozi doesn't really like me.@g]

41
3657:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3870:35:10,933.3330001831055
I'll go to the Land of Darkness and talk to the Judge of the Dead instead."

42
3870:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4025:20:10,933.3330001831055
When Wukong entered the Palace of Darkness, the Judge of the Dead frowned.

43
4025:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4105:35:10,933.3330001831055
"Why are you here, Wukong?

44
4105:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4303:45:10,933.3330001831055
You already made yourself immortal by crossing [n@out your name in the Directory."

45
4303:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4372:21:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong laughed.

46
4372:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4455:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"I wondered if you would remember that.

4455:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4530:28:30,933.3330001831055
I'm looking for Squire Kou's name."@g]

48
4530:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4725:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Squire Kou?" The judge opened the Directory and flipped through some pages.

49
4725:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4873:51:50,933.3330001831055
"Ah, yes. He died two days ago.

50
4873:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5011:18:30,933.3330001831055
He now works for the bodhisattva Dayuan in the Jade Palace.

5011:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5136:50:10,933.3330001831055
It's here in the Land of Darkness."

5136:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5246:38:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong went to the Jade Palace.

53
5246:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5362:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Greetings, Sun Wukong," said the bodhisattva.

54
5362:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5466:25:10,933.3330001831055
"Greetings, Bodhisattva." The monkey bowed.

5466:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5621:11:50,933.3330001831055
"Two nights ago a friend of mine, Squire Kou, was killed and brought here.

5706:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5777:48:30,933.3330001831055

5849:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5912:50:10,933.3330001831055
"Yes," said Wukong.

60
5912:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6054:33:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm helping the Tang Monk reach the Western Paradise [n@to fetch the True Scriptures.

6054:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6142:51:50,933.3330001831055
The squire was very kind to us."

62
6142:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6195:03:30,933.3330001831055
The bodhisattva smiled.

63
6195:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6393:06:50,933.3330001831055

6393:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6595:51:50,933.3330001831055
The bodhisattva brought Wukong to an office.

65
6595:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6827:26:50,933.3330001831055

7723:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7824:18:30,933.3330001831055
The squire came out from behind his desk and bowed.
