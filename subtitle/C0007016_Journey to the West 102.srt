1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:17,290
Lady Kou ran into the courthouse early the next morning.

2
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:23,754
With tears in her eyes, she told the judge that she had lied the day before.

3
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:27,112
"The Tang Monk and his companions are innocent."

4
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:29,084
Lady Kou sniffed.

5
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:31,541
"Please release them."

6
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:33,306
The judge nodded.

7
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:36,500
"I was going to release the prisoners this morning."

8
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:41,420
He explained how the Wandering Spirit had visited him the night before.

9
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:43,430
Lady Kou gasped.

10
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:46,105
"My husband visited me last night!

11
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:49,945
We must release the prisoners at once."

12
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:54,894
They hurried to the Tang Monk's cell.

13
00:00:54,895 --> 00:01:03,365
A guard swung open the cell door.

14
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:09,559
"I'm glad to be out of there," said Wujing.

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,029
"Me too," said Bajie with a yawn.

16
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,305
"The beds were very uncomfortable."

17
00:01:16,306 --> 00:01:19,281
Lady Kou bowed to the Tang Monk.

18
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:23,143
"I framed you for killing my husband," she said.

19
00:01:23,144 --> 00:01:24,762
"Please forgive me.

20
00:01:24,763 --> 00:01:27,698
It was a terrible thing to do."

21
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:30,761
"That's right!" shouted Wukong.

22
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:34,328
"It was a really terrible thing to do!"

23
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:38,120
The Tang Monk put his hand on the monkey's shoulder.

24
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:39,879
"Don't yell, Wukong."

25
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,047
He looked at Lady Kou.

26
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:43,517
"We forgive you.

27
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:45,823
The squire was a kind man.

28
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:50,744
His death is a terrible tragedy."

29
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:52,782
Wukong rubbed his chin.

30
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:56,477
"I can probably bring him back to life."

31
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,732
Lady Kou and the judge were shocked.

32
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:03,535
"Can you really do that?" asked Lady Kou.

33
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:05,377
The Tang Monk smiled.

34
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:07,068
"Yes, he can.

35
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:11,125
Wukong brought the king of the Black Rooster Kingdom back to life."

36
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:13,036
He turned to the monkey.

37
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:15,718
"The sage Laozi helped you that time.

38
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,905
Will you ask him for help again?"

39
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:20,112
"No," said Wukong.

40
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:22,617
"Laozi doesn't really like me.

41
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:30,274
I'll go to the Land of Darkness and talk to the Judge of the Dead instead."

42
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:35,845
When Wukong entered the Palace of Darkness, the Judge of the Dead frowned.

43
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:38,734
"Why are you here, Wukong?

44
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:45,868
You already made yourself immortal by crossing out your name in the Directory."

45
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:48,338
Wukong laughed.

46
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:51,341
"I wondered if you would remember that.

47
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:54,030
I'm looking for Squire Kou's name."

48
00:02:54,031 --> 00:03:01,065
"Squire Kou?" The judge opened the Directory and flipped through some pages.

49
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:06,392
"Ah, yes. He died two days ago.

50
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:11,340
He now works for the bodhisattva Dayuan in the Jade Palace.

51
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:15,859
It's here in the Land of Darkness."

52
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,812
Wukong went to the Jade Palace.

53
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:23,993
"Greetings, Sun Wukong," said the bodhisattva.

54
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:27,724
"Greetings, Bodhisattva." The monkey bowed.

55
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:33,296
"Two nights ago a friend of mine, Squire Kou, was killed and brought here.

56
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:36,369
I would like to bring him back to Earth."

57
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,934
The bodhisattva raised an eyebrow.

58
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:41,502
"You want him to return to life?"

59
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:43,795
"Yes," said Wukong.

60
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:48,897
"I'm helping the Tang Monk reach the Western Paradise to fetch the True Scriptures.

61
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:52,076
The squire was very kind to us."

62
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:53,955
The bodhisattva smiled.

63
00:03:53,956 --> 00:04:01,085
"Very well. The squire may return to Earth until it's time for him to come back here."

64
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:08,384
The bodhisattva brought Wukong to an office.

65
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:16,721
Squire Kou was sitting behind a large desk, smiling, as he studied some documents.

66
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:20,406
His eyes sparkled when he saw Wukong.

67
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:23,819
"It's good to see you, Wukong!" said the squire.

68
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,737
"What are you doing here?"

69
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:29,094
"I have good news," said the monkey.

70
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:31,417
"Your life isn't over yet.

71
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:33,814
I'm taking you back to Earth."

72
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,160
The squire looked confused.

73
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:40,224
He glanced at the bodhisattva.

74
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:42,307
The bodhisattva nodded.

75
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:44,510
"You may return to Earth.

76
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:48,988
When your life is over, you will return to your job here."

77
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:52,608
The squire came out from behind his desk and bowed.

78
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:55,030
"Thank you, Bodhisattva.

79
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:59,550
I am happy here, but I would love to see my wife and friends again."

80
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:02,563
Wukong moved closer to the squire.

81
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:05,156
"You'll be home soon, Squire."

82
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:15,251
The monkey recited a spell, and the squire vanished.
