1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,477
Monkey sailed over the ocean for a long time.

2
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:22,590
Finally he arrived at a new land.

3
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:27,090
He walked for many years, visiting towns and meeting people.

4
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:30,506
But he didn't find a sage anywhere.

5
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:35,947
Eventually he came to mountains covered in thick forest.

6
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:40,956
He headed up a steep mountain trail and soon heard chopping.

7
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,648
A woodcutter was chopping firewood.

8
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,917
"Hello," said Monkey. "Are there any sages in these mountains?"

9
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:52,384
The woodcutter dropped his ax.

10
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:56,394
[g@"You're . . . a monkey!" he said.

11
00:00:56,395 --> 00:00:58,284
"And you're talking!"@g]

12
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:00,968
"Yes, I am," said Monkey.

13
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,768
[g@"And I want to live forever.

14
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:05,206
Do you know where I can find a sage?"@g]

15
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:07,413
[g@The woodcutter scratched his head.

16
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:10,055
"Well, yes," he said.@g]

17
00:01:10,056 --> 00:01:13,230
[g@"A sage named Subodhi lives on this mountain.

18
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:15,543
He is very wise."@g]

19
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:17,366
[g@Monkey was excited.

20
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:19,208
"Where can I find him?"@g]

21
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:24,118
"Just follow this trail, and you will come [n@to his home," said the woodcutter.

22
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,254
"Thank you!" said Monkey.

23
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:33,102
He waved good-bye to the woodcutter and ran up the trail.

24
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:38,013
Soon he saw a temple built into the side of the mountain.

25
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:42,517
Subodhi was sitting with his students in the main room of his temple.

26
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:45,670
He looked at his oldest student.

27
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:48,675
"Please go to the door," said Subodhi.

28
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,015
[g@"A new student is about to arrive.

29
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:52,380
Let him in."@g]

30
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,768
[g@The student looked confused.

31
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:57,848
"Okay, Master," he said.@g]

32
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:04,733
[g@The student got up and went to the door of the temple.

33
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:07,243
He looked outside.@g]

34
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:13,018
"Hello!" called Monkey. "I'm here to see Subodhi!"

35
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:17,326
A moment later Monkey was standing in front of the sage.

36
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:20,411
"I want to be your student," said Monkey.

37
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:23,271
[g@"But you're just a monkey," said Subodhi.

38
00:02:23,272 --> 00:02:25,789
"How can you be my student?"@g]

39
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,044
Monkey laughed. "I might be a monkey.

40
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:34,275
But I can walk and talk and do many other things.

41
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:37,733
[g@I traveled almost 13 years to get here.

42
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:40,247
I'm sure I can be your student."@g]

43
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:43,494
[g@Subodhi stared at Monkey for a moment.

44
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:47,288
"Who are your parents?" he asked.@g]

45
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:49,626
Monkey scratched his head.

46
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,236
[g@"I don't have parents," he said.

47
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:54,479
"I was born from a rock."@g]

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,933
"Interesting," said Subodhi.

49
00:02:56,934 --> 00:03:00,292
[g@"You were probably created by Heaven and Earth.

50
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:02,146
You may be my student.@g]

51
00:03:02,147 --> 00:03:03,864
[g@You need a name."

52
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:06,041
He thought for a moment.@g]

53
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:12,956
"I will call you Sun Wukong."

54
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:18,145
For the next seven years, Sun Wukong lived in Subodhi's temple.

55
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:25,549
The monkey spent his days meditating, listening to [n@his teacher's lessons, and doing chores.

56
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:33,127
One day, while Subodhi was giving a lesson, Wukong started to dance.

57
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:34,740
[g@Subodhi stood up.

58
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:40,992
"How dare you dance while I'm teaching?" he shouted.@g]

59
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:43,189
[g@"I'm sorry," said Wukong.

60
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,264
"But I was so happy, I needed to dance!"@g]

61
00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:50,417
Subodhi calmed down. "You're happy?"

62
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:54,636
"Yes," said the monkey. "I love learning from you."

63
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:58,049
"Wukong, you have been here a long time.

64
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,797
What would you like to learn from me?" asked Subodhi.

65
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:05,186
[g@Wukong shrugged. "I don't know.

66
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:07,265
You tell me what I should learn."@g]

67
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:11,855
"Well," said Subodhi, "I can teach you how to tell the future.

68
00:04:11,856 --> 00:04:13,589
Would you like that?"

69
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,932
"Maybe," said Wukong. "Will it make me live forever?"

70
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:20,622
"Of course not," said Subodhi.

71
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:23,314
[g@"Then forget it," said Wukong.

72
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:25,265
"Teach me something else."@g]

73
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:31,525
"Hmm," said Subodhi. "How about some magic breathing exercises?"

74
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:36,148
"Will they make me live forever?" asked Wukong.

75
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:40,150
"No," said Subodhi, frowning.

76
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:43,129
"Then I'm not interested," said Wukong.

77
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,125
Subodhi became angry.

78
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:52,709
He stood up and knocked Wukong on the head three times.

79
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,451
Then he left the room.

80
00:04:58,452 --> 00:05:03,590
"Wukong," said another student. "You were very rude to Master!"

81
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:06,231
The other students all agreed.

82
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:08,830
Wukong, however, smiled.

83
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:16,883
None of the other students knew it, but Subodhi [n@had given him a secret message.
