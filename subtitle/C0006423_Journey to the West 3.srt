1
00:00:11,000 --> 207:41:51,000
Monkey sailed over the ocean for a long time.

2
207:43:31,000 --> 321:56:51,000
Finally he arrived at a new land.

3
321:58:31,000 --> 446:56:51,000
He walked for many years, visiting towns and meeting people.

4
446:58:31,000 --> 541:50:11,000
But he didn't find a sage anywhere.

5
541:51:51,000 --> 692:58:31,000
Eventually he came to mountains covered in thick forest.

6
693:00:11,000 --> 832:06:51,000
He headed up a steep mountain trail and soon heard chopping.

7
832:08:31,000 --> 934:40:11,000
A woodcutter was chopping firewood.

8
934:41:51,000 --> 1053:15:11,000
"Hello," said Monkey. "Are there any sages in these mountains?"

9
1053:16:51,000 --> 1149:33:31,000
The woodcutter dropped his ax.

10
1149:35:11,000 --> 1260:56:51,000
[g@"You're . . . a monkey!" he said.

11
1260:58:31,000 --> 1313:26:51,000
"And you're talking!"@g]

12
1313:28:31,000 --> 1388:00:11,000
"Yes, I am," said Monkey.

13
1388:01:51,000 --> 1438:00:11,000
[g@"And I want to live forever.

14
1438:01:51,000 --> 1505:43:31,000
Do you know where I can find a sage?"@g]

15
1505:45:11,000 --> 1567:01:51,000
[g@The woodcutter scratched his head.

16
1567:03:31,000 --> 1640:25:11,000
"Well, yes," he said.@g]

17
1640:26:51,000 --> 1728:36:51,000
[g@"A sage named Subodhi lives on this mountain.

18
1728:38:31,000 --> 1792:51:51,000
He is very wise."@g]

19
1792:53:31,000 --> 1843:30:11,000
[g@Monkey was excited.

20
1843:31:51,000 --> 1894:40:11,000
"Where can I find him?"@g]

21
1894:41:51,000 --> 2031:03:31,000
"Just follow this trail, and you will come [n@to his home," said the woodcutter.

22
2031:05:11,000 --> 2173:43:31,000
"Thank you!" said Monkey.

23
2173:45:11,000 --> 2280:36:51,000
He waved good-bye to the woodcutter and ran up the trail.

24
2280:38:31,000 --> 2417:01:51,000
Soon he saw a temple built into the side of the mountain.

25
2417:03:31,000 --> 2542:08:31,000
Subodhi was sitting with his students in the main room of his temple.

26
2542:10:11,000 --> 2629:43:31,000
He looked at his oldest student.

27
2629:45:11,000 --> 2713:11:51,000
"Please go to the door," said Subodhi.

28
2713:13:31,000 --> 2778:11:51,000
[g@"A new student is about to arrive.

29
2778:13:31,000 --> 2816:06:51,000
Let him in."@g]

30
2816:08:31,000 --> 2882:26:51,000
[g@The student looked confused.

31
2882:28:31,000 --> 2968:00:11,000
"Okay, Master," he said.@g]

32
2968:01:51,000 --> 3159:15:11,000
[g@The student got up and went to the door of the temple.

33
3159:16:51,000 --> 3228:58:31,000
He looked outside.@g]

34
3229:00:11,000 --> 3389:23:31,000
"Hello!" called Monkey. "I'm here to see Subodhi!"

35
3389:25:11,000 --> 3509:03:31,000
A moment later Monkey was standing in front of the sage.

36
3509:05:11,000 --> 3594:45:11,000
"I want to be your student," said Monkey.

37
3594:46:51,000 --> 3674:11:51,000
[g@"But you're just a monkey," said Subodhi.

38
3674:13:31,000 --> 3744:08:31,000
"How can you be my student?"@g]

39
3744:10:11,000 --> 3862:20:11,000
Monkey laughed. "I might be a monkey.

40
3862:21:51,000 --> 3979:51:51,000
But I can walk and talk and do many other things.

41
3979:53:31,000 --> 4075:55:11,000
[g@I traveled almost 13 years to get here.

42
4075:56:51,000 --> 4145:45:11,000
I'm sure I can be your student."@g]

43
4145:46:51,000 --> 4235:56:51,000
[g@Subodhi stared at Monkey for a moment.

44
4235:58:31,000 --> 4341:20:11,000
"Who are your parents?" he asked.@g]

45
4341:21:51,000 --> 4406:16:51,000
Monkey scratched his head.

46
4406:18:31,000 --> 4478:46:51,000
[g@"I don't have parents," he said.

47
4478:48:31,000 --> 4541:05:11,000
"I was born from a rock."@g]

48
4541:06:51,000 --> 4609:15:11,000
"Interesting," said Subodhi.

49
4609:16:51,000 --> 4702:33:31,000
[g@"You were probably created by Heaven and Earth.

50
4702:35:11,000 --> 4754:03:31,000
You may be my student.@g]

51
4754:05:11,000 --> 4801:46:51,000
[g@You need a name."

52
4801:48:31,000 --> 4862:15:11,000
He thought for a moment.@g]

53
4862:16:51,000 --> 5054:20:11,000
"I will call you Sun Wukong."

54
5054:21:51,000 --> 5198:28:31,000
For the next seven years, Sun Wukong lived in Subodhi's temple.

55
5198:30:11,000 --> 5404:08:31,000
The monkey spent his days meditating, listening to [n@his teacher's lessons, and doing chores.

56
5404:10:11,000 --> 5614:38:31,000
One day, while Subodhi was giving a lesson, Wukong started to dance.

57
5614:40:11,000 --> 5659:26:51,000
[g@Subodhi stood up.

58
5659:28:31,000 --> 5833:06:51,000
"How dare you dance while I'm teaching?" he shouted.@g]

59
5833:08:31,000 --> 5894:08:31,000
[g@"I'm sorry," said Wukong.

60
5894:10:11,000 --> 5979:33:31,000
"But I was so happy, I needed to dance!"@g]

61
5979:35:11,000 --> 6094:55:11,000
Subodhi calmed down. "You're happy?"

62
6094:56:51,000 --> 6212:06:51,000
"Yes," said the monkey. "I love learning from you."

63
6212:08:31,000 --> 6306:55:11,000
"Wukong, you have been here a long time.

64
6306:56:51,000 --> 6411:01:51,000
What would you like to learn from me?" asked Subodhi.

65
6411:03:31,000 --> 6505:10:11,000
[g@Wukong shrugged. "I don't know.

66
6505:11:51,000 --> 6562:55:11,000
You tell me what I should learn."@g]

67
6562:56:51,000 --> 6690:25:11,000
"Well," said Subodhi, "I can teach you how to tell the future.

68
6690:26:51,000 --> 6738:35:11,000
Would you like that?"

69
6738:36:51,000 --> 6859:13:31,000
"Maybe," said Wukong. "Will it make me live forever?"

70
6859:15:11,000 --> 6933:56:51,000
"Of course not," said Subodhi.

71
6933:58:31,000 --> 7008:43:31,000
[g@"Then forget it," said Wukong.

72
7008:45:11,000 --> 7062:55:11,000
"Teach me something else."@g]

73
7062:56:51,000 --> 7236:48:31,000
"Hmm," said Subodhi. "How about some magic breathing exercises?"

74
7236:50:11,000 --> 7365:13:31,000
"Will they make me live forever?" asked Wukong.

75
7365:15:11,000 --> 7476:23:31,000
"No," said Subodhi, frowning.

76
7476:25:11,000 --> 7559:08:31,000
"Then I'm not interested," said Wukong.

77
7559:10:11,000 --> 7642:21:51,000
Subodhi became angry.

78
7642:23:31,000 --> 7825:15:11,000
He stood up and knocked Wukong on the head three times.

79
7825:16:51,000 --> 7984:45:11,000
Then he left the room.

80
7984:46:51,000 --> 8127:30:11,000
"Wukong," said another student. "You were very rude to Master!"

81
8127:31:51,000 --> 8200:51:51,000
The other students all agreed.

82
8200:53:31,000 --> 8273:03:31,000
Wukong, however, smiled.

83
8273:05:11,000 --> 8496:45:11,000
None of the other students knew it, but Subodhi [n@had given him a secret message.
