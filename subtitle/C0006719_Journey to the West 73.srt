00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 248:11:50,933.3329999446869
Wujing watched as the fake Wujing fed the horse some hay.

2
248:13:30,933.3329999446869 --> 385:08:30,933.3329999446869
"I don't know how you made fake versions of us, [n@Wukong," said the purple spirit.

3
385:10:10,933.3329999446869 --> 515:30:10,933.3329999446869
"But you won't get the True Scriptures without the real Tang Monk."

4
515:31:50,933.3329999446869 --> 676:46:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong folded his arms. "Oh yes, I will."

5
676:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 785:35:10,933.3330001831055
Wujing leaped into the air and flew south.

6
785:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 892:33:30,933.3330001831055
"I'll tell the bodhisattva what Wukong is doing," he thought.

7
892:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 976:20:10,933.3330001831055
"She can stop him."

8
976:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1132:31:50,933.3330001831055
When Wujing arrived at Mount Potalaka, he was even more shocked.

9
1132:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1248:36:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong was meditating in the bodhisattva's garden.

10
1248:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1382:10:10,933.3330001831055
"Wukong!" cried Wujing. "How did you get here so fast?"

11
1382:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1465:30:10,933.3330001831055
"What are you talking about?" asked the monkey.

12
1465:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1601:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Guanyin came out of her pagoda.

13
1601:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1683:25:10,933.3330001831055
"Wujing, what are you doing here?"@g]

14
1683:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1743:13:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The purple spirit bowed.

15
1743:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1830:55:10,933.3330001831055
"Bodhisattva, I must speak with you.@g]

16
1830:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1957:10:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong has made fake versions of me, Bajie, and the Tang Monk.

17
1957:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2041:18:30,933.3330001831055
He's planning to make the journey without us."

18
2041:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2116:10:10,933.3330001831055
"What!" shouted Wukong.

19
2116:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2184:46:50,933.3330001831055
Wujing glanced at the monkey.

20
2184:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2271:15:10,933.3330001831055
"I just saw him on the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

21
2271:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2392:58:30,933.3330001831055
I don't know how he got here before me."

22
2393:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2483:43:30,933.3330001831055
"You're lying!" yelled Wukong.

23
2483:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2588:40:10,933.3330001831055
Guanyin smiled. "You're mistaken, Wujing.

24
2588:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2672:21:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong has been here the whole time."

25
2672:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2776:40:10,933.3330001831055
Wujing was surprised. "He has?"

26
2776:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2842:00:10,933.3330001831055
Guanyin nodded.

27
2842:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2891:50:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong made a fist.

28
2891:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2958:16:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Someone is pretending to be me!

29
2958:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3035:26:50,933.3330001831055
And he's living on my mountain!@g]

30
3035:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3084:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@I'm going there right now.

31
3084:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3154:01:50,933.3330001831055
I'm going to destroy him!"@g]

32
3154:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3346:08:30,933.3330001831055
"I'll go with you," said Wujing.

33
3346:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3533:23:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong and Wujing soon arrived on the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

34
3533:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3666:38:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey's eyes burned with anger when he saw the fake Wukong.

35
3666:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3768:20:10,933.3330001831055
"Who are you?" demanded Wukong.

36
3768:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3872:55:10,933.3330001831055
"Who are [i@you?@i]" asked the fake Wukong.

37
3872:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4065:41:50,933.3330001831055
"I am Sun Wukong, king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain!"

38
4065:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4132:55:10,933.3330001831055
"No," said the other monkey.

39
4132:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4261:13:30,933.3330001831055
"[i@I@i] am Sun Wukong, king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain!"

40
4261:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4379:11:50,933.3330001831055
Furious, Wukong pulled out his iron bar.

41
4379:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4552:21:50,933.3330001831055
The fake Wukong pulled out his iron bar.

42
4552:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4682:41:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong attacked, and so did the fake Wukong. [i@Clang!@i]

43
4682:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4788:55:10,933.3330001831055
The ground shook as the iron bars crashed into each other.

44
4788:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4909:28:30,933.3330001831055
The two monkeys fought with fury.

45
4909:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5046:28:30,933.3330001831055
Wujing watched as one Wukong struck the other. [i@Crack!@i]

46
5046:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5219:53:30,933.3330001831055
The other Wukong blocked the bar and swung back. [i@Bam!@i]

47
5219:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5339:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Wujing, help me!" cried one Wukong.

48
5339:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5461:51:50,933.3330001831055
Wujing raised his spear and was about to enter the fight.

49
5461:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5508:35:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The other Wukong shouted.

50
5508:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5590:40:10,933.3330001831055
"No, Wujing! Help [i@me@i]!"@g]

51
5590:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5711:43:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wujing looked from one Wukong to the other.

52
5711:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5801:18:30,933.3330001831055
"Who is the real Wukong?"@g]

53
5801:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5926:11:50,933.3330001831055
"I am!" shouted one Wukong as he struck at the other.

54
5926:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6106:56:50,933.3330001831055
"No!" shouted the other Wukong, blocking the first one's attack. "[i@I@i] am!"

55
6106:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6200:55:10,933.3330001831055
"Don't listen to him!" cried one monkey.

56
6200:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6364:03:30,933.3330001831055
"Don't listen to [i@him@i]!" cried the other.

57
6364:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6425:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wujing stamped his foot.

58
6425:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6506:31:50,933.3330001831055
"Stop fighting!" he shouted.@g]

59
6506:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6588:38:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Instantly both monkeys stopped fighting.

60
6588:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6652:30:10,933.3330001831055
They looked at the purple spirit.@g]

61
6652:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6774:46:50,933.3330001831055
"I don't know which one of you is the real Wukong," said Wujing.

62
6774:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6824:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Go to Mount Potalaka.

63
6824:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6902:15:10,933.3330001831055
Guanyin will be able to tell who is who.@g]

64
6902:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7018:48:30,933.3330001831055
I will return to the Tang Monk to tell him what's going on."

65
7018:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7112:08:30,933.3330001831055
The two Wukongs glanced at each other.

66
7112:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7187:05:10,933.3330001831055
"That's a good idea," said one of them.

67
7187:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7314:10:10,933.3330001831055
"Guanyin will easily see that I am the real Wukong."

68
7314:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7407:28:30,933.3330001831055
"It [i@is@i] a good idea," the other agreed.

69
7407:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7578:20:10,933.3330001831055
"Guanyin will easily see that [i@I@i] am the real Wukong."

70
7578:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7688:31:50,933.3330001831055
Soon the two Wukongs stood before Guanyin.

71
7688:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7767:21:50,933.3330001831055
She looked carefully at each one.

72
7767:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7907:05:10,933.3330001831055
"I can't tell which one of you is the real Wukong," she said.

73
7907:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7992:11:50,933.3330001831055
[g@One Wukong took a deep breath.

74
7992:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8048:05:10,933.3330001831055
"Use the Tight Headband spell.@g]

75
8048:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8170:23:30,933.3330001831055
The spell will work only with my headbandâ€”the real headband."

76
8170:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8230:58:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Yes!" said the other one.

77
8231:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8270:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Use the Tight Headband spell!@g]

78
8270:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8533:03:30,933.3330001831055
The spell will only work with [i@my@i] headband."
