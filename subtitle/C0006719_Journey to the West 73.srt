1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:19,868
Wujing watched as the fake Wujing fed the horse some hay.

2
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:24,798
"I don't know how you made fake versions of us, Wukong," said the purple spirit.

3
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:29,491
"But you won't get the True Scriptures without the real Tang Monk."

4
00:00:29,492 --> 00:00:35,297
Wukong folded his arms. "Oh yes, I will."

5
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:39,214
Wujing leaped into the air and flew south.

6
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:43,065
"I'll tell the bodhisattva what Wukong is doing," he thought.

7
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:46,081
"She can stop him."

8
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:51,704
When Wujing arrived at Mount Potalaka, he was even more shocked.

9
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:55,883
Wukong was meditating in the bodhisattva's garden.

10
00:00:55,884 --> 00:01:00,691
"Wukong!" cried Wujing. "How did you get here so fast?"

11
00:01:00,692 --> 00:01:03,691
"What are you talking about?" asked the monkey.

12
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:08,598
Guanyin came out of her pagoda.

13
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:11,536
"Wujing, what are you doing here?"

14
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:13,689
The purple spirit bowed.

15
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,846
"Bodhisattva, I must speak with you.

16
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:21,391
Wukong has made fake versions of me, Bajie, and the Tang Monk.

17
00:01:21,392 --> 00:01:24,420
He's planning to make the journey without us."

18
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:27,115
"What!" shouted Wukong.

19
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:29,585
Wujing glanced at the monkey.

20
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:32,698
"I just saw him on the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

21
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:37,080
I don't know how he got here before me."

22
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:40,347
"You're lying!" yelled Wukong.

23
00:01:40,348 --> 00:01:44,125
Guanyin smiled. "You're mistaken, Wujing.

24
00:01:44,126 --> 00:01:47,138
Wukong has been here the whole time."

25
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:50,893
Wujing was surprised. "He has?"

26
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:53,245
Guanyin nodded.

27
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,039
Wukong made a fist.

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,431
"Someone is pretending to be me!

29
00:01:57,432 --> 00:02:00,209
And he's living on my mountain!

30
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,961
I'm going there right now.

31
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:04,478
I'm going to destroy him!"

32
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,394
"I'll go with you," said Wujing.

33
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:18,135
Wukong and Wujing soon arrived on the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

34
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:22,932
The monkey's eyes burned with anger when he saw the fake Wukong.

35
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:26,593
"Who are you?" demanded Wukong.

36
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:30,358
"Who are you?" asked the fake Wukong.

37
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:37,298
"I am Sun Wukong, king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain!"

38
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:39,718
"No," said the other monkey.

39
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,337
"I am Sun Wukong, king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain!"

40
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:48,584
Furious, Wukong pulled out his iron bar.

41
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:54,818
The fake Wukong pulled out his iron bar.

42
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,510
Wukong attacked, and so did the fake Wukong. Clang!

43
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:03,334
The ground shook as the iron bars crashed into each other.

44
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:07,674
The two monkeys fought with fury.

45
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:12,606
Wujing watched as one Wukong struck the other. Crack!

46
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:18,849
The other Wukong blocked the bar and swung back. Bam!

47
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,147
"Wujing, help me!" cried one Wukong.

48
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:27,560
Wujing raised his spear and was about to enter the fight.

49
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:29,242
The other Wukong shouted.

50
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:32,197
"No, Wujing! Help me!"

51
00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:36,555
Wujing looked from one Wukong to the other.

52
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:39,780
"Who is the real Wukong?"

53
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:44,276
"I am!" shouted one Wukong as he struck at the other.

54
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:50,783
"No!" shouted the other Wukong, blocking the first one's attack. "I am!"

55
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:54,166
"Don't listen to him!" cried one monkey.

56
00:03:54,167 --> 00:04:00,039
"Don't listen to him!" cried the other.

57
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,255
Wujing stamped his foot.

58
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:05,168
"Stop fighting!" he shouted.

59
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:08,124
Instantly both monkeys stopped fighting.

60
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,423
They looked at the purple spirit.

61
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:14,825
"I don't know which one of you is the real Wukong," said Wujing.

62
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:16,609
"Go to Mount Potalaka.

63
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,414
Guanyin will be able to tell who is who.

64
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:23,610
I will return to the Tang Monk to tell him what's going on."

65
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:26,970
The two Wukongs glanced at each other.

66
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:29,668
"That's a good idea," said one of them.

67
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,243
"Guanyin will easily see that I am the real Wukong."

68
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:37,602
"It is a good idea," the other agreed.

69
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:43,753
"Guanyin will easily see that I am the real Wukong."

70
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:47,720
Soon the two Wukongs stood before Guanyin.

71
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,558
She looked carefully at each one.

72
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,588
"I can't tell which one of you is the real Wukong," she said.

73
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:58,652
One Wukong took a deep breath.

74
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:00,664
"Use the Tight Headband spell.

75
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:05,067
The spell will work only with my headbandâ€”the real headband."

76
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:07,248
"Yes!" said the other one.

77
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:08,685
"Use the Tight Headband spell!

78
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:18,123
The spell will only work with my headband."
