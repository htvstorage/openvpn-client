1
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:18,006
The Jade Emperor was sitting on his throne in the Cloud Palace.

2
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:21,357
A messenger ran into the court.

3
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:23,836
"Your Majesty," he said.

4
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:28,040
"The Dragon King of the Eastern Sea is here to see you."

5
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,563
"Let him in," said the emperor.

6
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,398
The Dragon King entered and bowed.

7
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,963
"Your Majesty, I want to make a complaint.

8
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:42,466
Sun Wukong came to my palace and demanded I give him a weapon.

9
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:44,831
He was very rude."

10
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:48,498
Another messenger came in.

11
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:54,988
"The Judge of the Dead would like to speak with you, Your Majesty."

12
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,944
The judge came in and bowed.

13
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:03,782
"A monkey named Sun Wukong crossed out his name in the Directory.

14
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:06,343
I beg you to punish him!"

15
00:01:06,344 --> 00:01:09,555
The Jade Emperor rubbed his chin.

16
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:11,712
"Who is this Sun Wukong?

17
00:01:11,713 --> 00:01:14,776
And how did he become so powerful?"

18
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:17,758
The emperor's captain stepped forward.

19
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,149
"Sun Wukong is the monkey who was born from a rock three hundred years ago.

20
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,445
I don't know how he became so powerful."

21
00:01:26,446 --> 00:01:29,906
"I remember him," said the Jade Emperor.

22
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:32,864
"I don't care how powerful he is.

23
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:36,538
He is causing too much trouble on Earth.

24
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,857
Gather some troops, and go down to the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

25
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:44,439
I want Sun Wukong arrested!"

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,892
The spirit of the planet Venus stepped forward.

27
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:51,616
"Your Majesty," said Venus.

28
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:55,987
"Perhaps we could give Wukong a job here in Heaven."

29
00:01:55,988 --> 00:01:58,902
The Jade Emperor raised his eyebrows.

30
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:01,067
"Why would we do that?"

31
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:05,405
"If he's here, we can keep an eye on him," said Venus.

32
00:02:05,406 --> 00:02:09,166
"It will be easy to keep him out of trouble."

33
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,775
"Very well," said the emperor.

34
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:15,447
"Invite Wukong to come to live in Heaven.

35
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:22,697
He will be in charge of the Royal Peach Garden."

36
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:27,964
Wukong was telling his subjects about his adventure in the Land of Darkness.

37
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:33,199
"After I crossed out my name," he said, "I crossed out all of your names too.

38
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,148
We will all live forever!"

39
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:38,167
The monkeys and apes cheered.

40
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:41,564
"Hooray for the Monkey King!"

41
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:45,566
Wukong noticed a spirit standing nearby.

42
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:49,825
He pulled out his iron bar. "Who are you?"

43
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:52,653
"I am Venus," said the spirit.

44
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:55,942
"I have an invitation from the Jade Emperor.

45
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:59,163
He would like you to come to live in Heaven."

46
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:07,969
Wukong smiled. "At last he has invited me."

47
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:14,553
When Wukong entered the royal court in the Cloud Palace, he didn't bow.

48
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:19,335
"You're supposed to bow before the emperor," whispered Venus.

49
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:23,675
Wukong laughed. "I'm just as powerful as he is.

50
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:27,559
Maybe he should bow before me!"

51
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,220
Everyone but the Jade Emperor gasped.

52
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:33,436
Wukong looked at the emperor.

53
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:35,684
"I'm glad you invited me.

54
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:40,518
I guess you finally realized I should be living up here with all of you."

55
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,649
"Show some respect," said Venus.

56
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,544
The Jade Emperor looked at Venus and smiled.

57
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:49,579
"Wukong is new here.

58
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,039
He can be excused for not acting the right way."

59
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,123
He looked at Wukong.

60
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:58,625
"I'm putting you in charge of the Royal Peach Garden.

61
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:01,535
You will have a home here in Heaven.

62
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:06,171
I hope you won't cause any more trouble."

63
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:10,116
"That sounds perfect!" said Wukong.

64
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:14,766
The next morning a gardener showed Wukong the peach garden.

65
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:20,387
Bright, glowing peaches hung from every branch.

66
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:25,258
"The peaches in this garden are not like peaches on Earth," said the gardener.

67
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,883
"These peaches take thousands of years to become ripe.

68
00:04:28,884 --> 00:04:35,650
Anybody who takes a bite of one will live forever."

69
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:40,823
Each morning Wukong inspected the trees in the garden.

70
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:46,069
He took his job very seriously.

71
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,838
"These peaches look delicious," Wukong thought one day.

72
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,012
He looked around.

73
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:56,299
None of the gardeners were in sight.

74
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:02,067
"Maybe I'll eat one."
