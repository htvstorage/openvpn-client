1
00:00:11,134 --> 190:53:31,134
The Jade Emperor was sitting on his throne in the Cloud Palace.

2
190:55:11,134 --> 283:58:31,134
[g@A messenger ran into the court.

3
284:00:11,134 --> 352:50:11,134
"Your Majesty," he said.@g]

4
352:51:51,134 --> 469:36:51,134
"The Dragon King of the Eastern Sea is here to see you."

5
469:38:31,134 --> 567:28:31,134
"Let him in," said the emperor.

6
567:30:11,134 --> 646:13:31,134
The Dragon King entered and bowed.

7
646:15:11,134 --> 745:15:11,134
"Your Majesty, I want to make a complaint.

8
745:16:51,134 --> 870:20:11,134
Sun Wukong came to my palace and demanded I give him a weapon.

9
870:21:51,134 --> 936:01:51,134
He was very rude."

10
936:03:31,134 --> 1037:53:31,134
Another messenger came in.

11
1037:55:11,134 --> 1218:10:11,134
"The Judge of the Dead would like to speak with you, Your Majesty."

12
1218:11:51,134 --> 1300:16:51,134
The judge came in and bowed.

13
1300:18:31,134 --> 1462:26:51,134
"A monkey named Sun Wukong crossed out his name in the Directory.

14
1462:28:31,134 --> 1533:35:11,134
I beg you to punish him!"

15
1533:36:51,134 --> 1622:48:31,134
The Jade Emperor rubbed his chin.

16
1622:50:11,134 --> 1682:43:31,134
[g@"Who is this Sun Wukong?

17
1682:45:11,134 --> 1767:50:11,134
And how did he become so powerful?"@g]

18
1767:51:51,134 --> 1850:40:11,134
The emperor's captain stepped forward.

19
1850:41:51,134 --> 2000:25:11,134
"Sun Wukong is the monkey who was born [n@from a rock three hundred years ago.

20
2000:26:51,134 --> 2091:58:31,134
I don't know how he became so powerful."

21
2092:00:11,134 --> 2188:06:51,134
[g@"I remember him," said the Jade Emperor.

22
2188:08:31,134 --> 2270:16:51,134
"I don't care how powerful he is.@g]

23
2270:18:31,134 --> 2372:20:11,134
He is causing too much trouble on Earth.

24
2372:21:51,134 --> 2492:18:31,134
Gather some troops, and go down to the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

25
2492:20:11,134 --> 2591:48:31,134
I want Sun Wukong arrested!"

26
2591:50:11,134 --> 2715:30:11,134
The spirit of the planet Venus stepped forward.

27
2715:31:51,134 --> 2791:10:11,134
"Your Majesty," said Venus.

28
2791:11:51,134 --> 2912:35:11,134
"Perhaps we could give Wukong a job here in Heaven."

29
2912:36:51,134 --> 2993:33:31,134
[g@The Jade Emperor raised his eyebrows.

30
2993:35:11,134 --> 3053:41:51,134
"Why would we do that?"@g]

31
3053:43:31,134 --> 3174:11:51,134
"If he's here, we can keep an eye on him," said Venus.

32
3174:13:31,134 --> 3278:40:11,134
"It will be easy to keep him out of trouble."

33
3278:41:51,134 --> 3351:08:31,134
[g@"Very well," said the emperor.

34
3351:10:11,134 --> 3453:08:31,134
"Invite Wukong to come to live in Heaven.@g]

35
3453:10:11,134 --> 3654:31:51,134
He will be in charge of the Royal Peach Garden."

36
3654:33:31,134 --> 3800:50:11,134
Wukong was telling his subjects about his adventure in the Land of Darkness.

37
3800:51:51,134 --> 3946:15:11,134
"After I crossed out my name," he said, [n@"I crossed out all of your names too.

38
3946:16:51,134 --> 4028:10:11,134
We will all live forever!"

39
4028:11:51,134 --> 4084:15:11,134
[g@The monkeys and apes cheered.

40
4084:16:51,134 --> 4178:36:51,134
"Hooray for the Monkey King!"@g]

41
4178:38:31,134 --> 4289:46:51,134
Wukong noticed a spirit standing nearby.

42
4289:48:31,134 --> 4408:05:11,134
He pulled out his iron bar. "Who are you?"

43
4408:06:51,134 --> 4486:38:31,134
[g@"I am Venus," said the spirit.

44
4486:40:11,134 --> 4578:00:11,134
"I have an invitation from the Jade Emperor.@g]

45
4578:01:51,134 --> 4667:28:31,134
He would like you to come to live in Heaven."

46
4667:30:11,134 --> 4912:05:11,134
Wukong smiled. "At last he has invited me."

47
4912:06:51,134 --> 5094:58:31,134
When Wukong entered the royal court in the Cloud Palace, he didn't bow.

48
5095:00:11,134 --> 5227:48:31,134
"You're supposed to bow before the emperor," whispered Venus.

49
5227:50:11,134 --> 5348:21:51,134
Wukong laughed. "I'm just as powerful as he is.

50
5348:23:31,134 --> 5456:15:11,134
Maybe he should bow before me!"

51
5456:16:51,134 --> 5557:56:51,134
Everyone but the Jade Emperor gasped.

52
5557:58:31,134 --> 5619:30:11,134
[g@Wukong looked at the emperor.

53
5619:31:51,134 --> 5681:56:51,134
"I'm glad you invited me.@g]

54
5681:58:31,134 --> 5816:13:31,134
I guess you finally realized I should be living up here with all of you."

55
5816:15:11,134 --> 5903:11:51,134
"Show some respect," said Venus.

56
5903:13:31,134 --> 6011:23:31,134
The Jade Emperor looked at Venus and smiled.

57
6011:25:11,134 --> 6067:55:11,134
[g@"Wukong is new here.

58
6067:56:51,134 --> 6164:01:51,134
He can be excused for not acting the right way."@g]

59
6164:03:31,134 --> 6221:55:11,134
He looked at Wukong.

60
6221:56:51,134 --> 6319:11:51,134
"I'm putting you in charge of the Royal Peach Garden.

61
6319:13:31,134 --> 6400:01:51,134
You will have a home here in Heaven.

62
6400:03:31,134 --> 6528:48:31,134
I hope you won't cause any more trouble."

63
6528:50:11,134 --> 6638:23:31,134
"That sounds perfect!" said Wukong.

64
6638:25:11,134 --> 6767:33:31,134
The next morning a gardener showed Wukong the peach garden.

65
6767:35:11,134 --> 6923:41:51,134
Bright, glowing peaches hung from every branch.

66
6923:43:31,134 --> 7059:00:11,134
"The peaches in this garden are not like [n@peaches on Earth," said the gardener.

67
7059:01:51,134 --> 7159:41:51,134
"These peaches take thousands of years to become ripe.

68
7159:43:31,134 --> 7347:40:11,134
Anybody who takes a bite of one will live forever."

69
7347:41:51,134 --> 7491:21:51,134
Each morning Wukong inspected the trees in the garden.

70
7491:23:31,134 --> 7637:05:11,134
He took his job very seriously.

71
7637:06:51,134 --> 7741:46:51,134
[g@"These peaches look delicious," Wukong thought one day.

72
7741:48:31,134 --> 7802:10:11,134
He looked around.@g]

73
7802:11:51,134 --> 7921:15:11,134
[g@None of the gardeners were in sight.

74
7921:16:51,134 --> 8081:28:31,134
"Maybe I'll eat one."@g]
