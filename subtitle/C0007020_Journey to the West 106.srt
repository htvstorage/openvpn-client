00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 146:38:30,933.3330000042915
Guanyin looked at the messenger in surprise.

2
146:40:10,933.3330000042915 --> 234:45:10,933.3329999446869
"What is the problem?" she asked.

3
234:46:50,933.3329999446869 --> 343:10:10,933.3329999446869
"It's about the Tang Monk," said the messenger.

4
343:11:50,933.3329999446869 --> 471:18:30,933.3329999446869
"To become a buddha, he needs to face one hundred challenges.

5
471:20:10,933.3329999446869 --> 585:40:10,933.3329999446869
I was just looking at the list of challenges he's faced.

6
585:41:50,933.3329999446869 --> 694:55:10,933.3330001831055
There are only 99 challenges on the list.

7
694:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 913:26:50,933.3330001831055
He must face one more challenge to become a buddha!"

8
913:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1048:40:10,933.3330001831055
"We're moving so fast!" said the Tang Monk, smiling.

9
1048:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1123:43:30,933.3330001831055
The travelers were flying back east.

10
1123:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1282:38:30,933.3330001831055
The guard from the Thunderclap Monastery was using a spell to carry them.

11
1282:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1396:15:10,933.3330001831055
"I wish the whole journey had been this easy," said Bajie.

12
1396:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1453:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong laughed.

13
1453:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1566:00:10,933.3330001831055
"Master was still mortal before [n@we reached the Western Paradise.@g]

14
1566:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1633:06:50,933.3330001831055
He couldn't be carried then."

15
1633:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1681:53:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wujing looked ahead.

16
1681:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1773:43:30,933.3330001831055
"We'll reach the Tang Empire soon."@g]

17
1773:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1869:03:30,933.3330001831055
Just then a messenger caught up with them.

18
1869:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1966:01:50,933.3330001831055
The messenger whispered something in the guard's ear.

19
1966:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2052:05:10,933.3330001831055
The guard glanced quickly at the travelers.

20
2052:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2151:06:50,933.3330001831055
Then he looked back at the messenger and nodded.

21
2151:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2292:21:50,933.3330001831055
Instantly the spell broke, and the travelers fell from the sky.

22
2292:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2525:16:50,933.3330001831055
[i@Bam!@i] They slammed into the ground next to a wide river.

23
2525:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2660:06:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong stood up and saw the guard and messenger flying back west.

24
2660:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2721:13:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey shook his head.

25
2721:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2760:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"What happened?"

26
2760:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2869:01:50,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk stood up and brushed dirt from his robe.@g]

27
2869:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2950:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Why did the guard drop us?"

28
2950:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3042:16:50,933.3330001831055
"I'll tell you why," said Bajie.

29
3042:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3080:43:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"He's a villain!

30
3080:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3170:03:30,933.3330001831055
He thinks it's funny to drop people!"@g]

31
3170:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3345:33:30,933.3330001831055
The pig waved his fist at the guard, who was now far away. "Villain!"

32
3345:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3436:23:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong turned slowly to the Tang Monk.

33
3436:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3523:53:30,933.3330001831055
"I think I know why he dropped us, Master.

34
3523:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3664:36:50,933.3330001831055
You must face one hundred challenges in order to become a buddha.

35
3664:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3781:41:50,933.3330001831055
You probably got to the Western Paradise before you'd faced all of them."

36
3781:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3863:16:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Oh no." The monk trembled.

37
3863:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3954:00:10,933.3330001831055
"So other bad things must happen now?"@g]

38
3954:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3995:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong nodded.

39
3995:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4133:43:30,933.3330001831055
"I hope there won't be too many more problems."@g]

40
4133:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4262:28:30,933.3330001831055
"The first problem is crossing this river," said Wujing.

41
4262:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4340:56:50,933.3330001831055
"It looks familiar," said the monk.

42
4340:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4460:33:30,933.3330001831055
"We must have crossed it during the journey west."

43
4460:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4626:56:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Suddenly a large form rose from the river.

44
4626:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4719:46:50,933.3330001831055
It was an enormous turtle.@g]

45
4719:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4865:31:50,933.3330001831055
"Greetings," said the turtle. "Do you remember me?"

46
4865:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4933:21:50,933.3330001831055
The travelers all smiled.

47
4933:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5008:26:50,933.3330001831055
"Yes, we do," said the Tang Monk.

48
5008:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5102:06:50,933.3330001831055
"You carried us over this river many years ago."

49
5102:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5166:13:30,933.3330001831055
"Yes," said the turtle.

50
5166:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5274:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"And I will gladly carry you across again.

51
5274:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5401:50:10,933.3330001831055
Hop onto my back."@g]

52
5401:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5602:46:50,933.3330001831055
The travelers climbed on, and the turtle started across the river.

53
5602:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5769:10:10,933.3330001831055
Wujing and Bajie soon fell asleep while Wukong meditated.

54
5769:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5908:45:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk stayed awake too, sitting near the turtle's head.

55
5908:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6031:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Did you reach the Western Paradise?" asked the turtle.

56
6031:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6094:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

57
6094:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6168:35:10,933.3330001831055
"It is a wonderful place.@g]

58
6168:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6298:11:50,933.3330001831055
We are now returning to the East so I can deliver the True Scriptures."

59
6298:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6382:55:10,933.3330001831055
"Good," said the turtle.

60
6382:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6541:03:30,933.3330001831055
"Did you ask Buddha when I would be reborn as a human?"

61
6541:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6618:43:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The monk bit his lip.

62
6618:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6736:06:50,933.3330001831055
He had forgotten to ask the turtle's question!@g]

63
6736:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6844:53:30,933.3330001831055
"You're not answering," said the turtle.

64
6844:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6990:26:50,933.3330001831055
"I'm sorry," said the monk. "I, uhâ€”"

65
6990:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7021:50:10,933.3330001831055
[i@Splash!@i]

66
7021:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7226:36:50,933.3330001831055
The turtle suddenly dived under the water, dumping everyone off his back.

67
7226:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7381:15:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong's eyes flew open as he hit the cold water.

68
7381:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7470:08:30,933.3330001831055
He leaped into the air.@g]

69
7470:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7674:58:30,933.3330001831055
Bajie, Wujing, and the horse quickly flew across the river.

70
7675:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7818:28:30,933.3330001831055
But the Tang Monk was thrashing furiously in the rushing water.

71
7818:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7910:05:10,933.3330001831055
"Help!" yelled the monk.

72
7910:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8098:06:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong cast a spell and lifted the monk and the bag from the river.

73
8098:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8245:16:50,933.3330001831055
When everyone was on dry land, the monkey turned the bag upside down.

74
8245:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8356:23:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Water poured out, followed by the scrolls.

75
8356:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8438:13:30,933.3330001831055
They were soaked.@g]

76
8438:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8535:51:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"The True Scriptures!" cried the Tang Monk.

77
8535:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8688:30:10,933.3330001831055
"They're ruined!"@g]
