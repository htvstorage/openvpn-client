1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:16,212
Guanyin looked at the messenger in surprise.

2
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:19,384
"What is the problem?" she asked.

3
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:23,287
"It's about the Tang Monk," said the messenger.

4
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:27,900
"To become a buddha, he needs to face one hundred challenges.

5
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:32,017
I was just looking at the list of challenges he's faced.

6
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:35,950
There are only 99 challenges on the list.

7
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:43,817
He must face one more challenge to become a buddha!"

8
00:00:43,818 --> 00:00:48,685
"We're moving so fast!" said the Tang Monk, smiling.

9
00:00:48,686 --> 00:00:51,387
The travelers were flying back east.

10
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:57,108
The guard from the Thunderclap Monastery was using a spell to carry them.

11
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:01,198
"I wish the whole journey had been this easy," said Bajie.

12
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,274
Wukong laughed.

13
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:07,309
"Master was still mortal before we reached the Western Paradise.

14
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,725
He couldn't be carried then."

15
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:11,481
Wujing looked ahead.

16
00:01:11,482 --> 00:01:14,787
"We'll reach the Tang Empire soon."

17
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:18,219
Just then a messenger caught up with them.

18
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,710
The messenger whispered something in the guard's ear.

19
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:24,808
The guard glanced quickly at the travelers.

20
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:28,373
Then he looked back at the messenger and nodded.

21
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:33,458
Instantly the spell broke, and the travelers fell from the sky.

22
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:41,843
Bam! They slammed into the ground next to a wide river.

23
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:46,697
Wukong stood up and saw the guard and messenger flying back west.

24
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:48,897
The monkey shook his head.

25
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:50,326
"What happened?"

26
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:54,218
The Tang Monk stood up and brushed dirt from his robe.

27
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:57,151
"Why did the guard drop us?"

28
00:01:57,152 --> 00:02:00,455
"I'll tell you why," said Bajie.

29
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:01,839
"He's a villain!

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,055
He thinks it's funny to drop people!"

31
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:11,373
The pig waved his fist at the guard, who was now far away. "Villain!"

32
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:14,643
Wukong turned slowly to the Tang Monk.

33
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:17,793
"I think I know why he dropped us, Master.

34
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:22,859
You must face one hundred challenges in order to become a buddha.

35
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,074
You probably got to the Western Paradise before you'd faced all of them."

36
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:30,011
"Oh no." The monk trembled.

37
00:02:30,012 --> 00:02:33,277
"So other bad things must happen now?"

38
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,775
Wukong nodded.

39
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:39,747
"I hope there won't be too many more problems."

40
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:44,382
"The first problem is crossing this river," said Wujing.

41
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:47,207
"It looks familiar," said the monk.

42
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:51,513
"We must have crossed it during the journey west."

43
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:57,503
Suddenly a large form rose from the river.

44
00:02:57,504 --> 00:03:00,845
It was an enormous turtle.

45
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:06,092
"Greetings," said the turtle. "Do you remember me?"

46
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:08,534
The travelers all smiled.

47
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:11,237
"Yes, we do," said the Tang Monk.

48
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:14,609
"You carried us over this river many years ago."

49
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,917
"Yes," said the turtle.

50
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:20,825
"And I will gladly carry you across again.

51
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:25,399
Hop onto my back."

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:32,633
The travelers climbed on, and the turtle started across the river.

53
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:38,623
Wujing and Bajie soon fell asleep while Wukong meditated.

54
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:43,648
The Tang Monk stayed awake too, sitting near the turtle's head.

55
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:48,067
"Did you reach the Western Paradise?" asked the turtle.

56
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:50,345
"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

57
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:53,002
"It is a wonderful place.

58
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:57,668
We are now returning to the East so I can deliver the True Scriptures."

59
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,718
"Good," said the turtle.

60
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,411
"Did you ask Buddha when I would be reborn as a human?"

61
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,207
The monk bit his lip.

62
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,433
He had forgotten to ask the turtle's question!

63
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:17,349
"You're not answering," said the turtle.

64
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,589
"I'm sorry," said the monk. "I, uhâ€”"

65
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,719
Splash!

66
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:31,091
The turtle suddenly dived under the water, dumping everyone off his back.

67
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:36,658
Wukong's eyes flew open as he hit the cold water.

68
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:39,858
He leaped into the air.

69
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:47,232
Bajie, Wujing, and the horse quickly flew across the river.

70
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:52,398
But the Tang Monk was thrashing furiously in the rushing water.

71
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,696
"Help!" yelled the monk.

72
00:04:55,697 --> 00:05:02,465
Wukong cast a spell and lifted the monk and the bag from the river.

73
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:07,763
When everyone was on dry land, the monkey turned the bag upside down.

74
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:11,763
Water poured out, followed by the scrolls.

75
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:14,709
They were soaked.

76
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,224
"The True Scriptures!" cried the Tang Monk.

77
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:23,719
"They're ruined!"
