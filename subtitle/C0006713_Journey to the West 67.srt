1
00:00:11,000 --> 163:28:31,000
"What are we going to do now?" cried Wukong.

2
163:30:11,000 --> 275:43:31,000
"One-Horned Buffalo stole all our weapons!"

3
275:45:11,000 --> 335:48:31,000
[g@The warrior rubbed his chin.

4
335:50:11,000 --> 403:58:31,000
He looked very serious.@g]

5
404:00:11,000 --> 476:21:51,000
"We can't go back to the Jade Emperor.

6
476:23:31,000 --> 591:10:11,000
He'll be angry if he finds out we couldn't arrest the demon."

7
591:11:51,000 --> 663:30:11,000
[g@"You're right," said the fire god.

8
663:31:51,000 --> 726:33:31,000
"We need a different plan.@g]

9
726:35:11,000 --> 800:58:31,000
It's getting dark out, almost nighttime.

10
801:00:11,000 --> 926:40:11,000
Maybe one of us can sneak into the cave and steal that metal ring."

11
926:41:51,000 --> 979:08:31,000
[g@The thunder god smiled.

12
979:10:11,000 --> 1063:21:51,000
"I know who's perfect for that job."@g]

13
1063:23:31,000 --> 1148:50:11,000
The others all looked at the god.

14
1148:51:51,000 --> 1272:36:51,000
"One of us is a master thief," the thunder god continued.

15
1272:38:31,000 --> 1412:11:51,000
"He once stole all the peaches from the Royal Peach Garden."

16
1412:13:31,000 --> 1509:11:51,000
Now everyone looked at Wukong.

17
1509:13:31,000 --> 1565:41:51,000
[g@The monkey pretended to laugh.

18
1565:43:31,000 --> 1649:50:11,000
"Ha-ha. Yes, it's true.@g]

19
1649:51:51,000 --> 1772:51:51,000
I used to steal things, but I know now that stealing is wrong.

20
1772:53:31,000 --> 1912:41:51,000
However, I will steal that metal ring because I need to save the Tang Monk.

21
1912:43:31,000 --> 1963:01:51,000
You all wait here."

22
1963:03:31,000 --> 2110:46:51,000
The monkey turned himself into a tiny bug and flew into the cave.

23
2110:48:31,000 --> 2308:08:31,000
He went down a long, dark tunnel followed by another tunnel.

24
2308:10:11,000 --> 2404:00:11,000
Then he heard One-Horned Buffalo.

25
2404:01:51,000 --> 2479:25:11,000
Wukong flew toward the voice.

26
2479:26:51,000 --> 2605:25:11,000
The demon was sitting on the edge of a bed, talking to himself.

27
2605:26:51,000 --> 2726:30:11,000
The metal ring was still on his arm.

28
2726:31:51,000 --> 2830:50:11,000
"It's time for bed," said the demon with a yawn.

29
2830:51:51,000 --> 2988:33:31,000
"I hope I can eat the Tang Monk tomorrow.

30
2988:35:11,000 --> 3174:10:11,000
I couldn't eat him today because of that annoying [n@monkey and his friends from Heaven."

31
3174:11:51,000 --> 3285:53:31,000
The demon lay down and was soon asleep.

32
3285:55:11,000 --> 3398:30:11,000
Wukong flew over and landed on the demon's arm.

33
3398:31:51,000 --> 3479:55:11,000
"I'll bite his arm," thought the monkey.

34
3479:56:51,000 --> 3573:03:31,000
"He'll get itchy and have to take off the metal ring."

35
3573:05:11,000 --> 3691:23:31,000
Wukong bit the demon's arm again and again.

36
3691:25:11,000 --> 3896:50:11,000
The demon rolled over and mumbled in his sleep, "Bugs . . . itchy . . ."

37
3896:51:51,000 --> 4014:08:31,000
He scratched his arm.

38
4014:10:11,000 --> 4086:53:31,000
Wukong bit him some more.

39
4086:55:11,000 --> 4143:03:31,000
[g@The demon scratched and scratched.

40
4143:05:11,000 --> 4228:25:11,000
But he didn't take off the metal ring.@g]

41
4228:26:51,000 --> 4313:51:51,000
"This isn't working," thought Wukong.

42
4313:53:31,000 --> 4436:16:51,000
He was about to leave the room when he spotted some things in the corner.

43
4436:18:31,000 --> 4529:48:31,000
He gasped. "Our weapons!"

44
4529:50:11,000 --> 4652:01:51,000
Quietly he changed back into himself.

45
4652:03:31,000 --> 4774:30:11,000
He made his iron bar small and put it in his ear.

46
4774:31:51,000 --> 4949:30:11,000
Then he grabbed the flaming spear, the thunderbolt, and the sword.

47
4949:31:51,000 --> 5027:38:31,000
Outside the cave the others were waiting.

48
5027:40:11,000 --> 5092:21:51,000
The warrior made a fist.

49
5092:23:31,000 --> 5172:15:11,000
[g@"I hope Wukong steals that metal ring.

50
5172:16:51,000 --> 5249:13:31,000
I am so angry at that demon!"@g]

51
5249:15:11,000 --> 5329:38:31,000
[g@"So am I," said the fire god.

52
5329:40:11,000 --> 5425:21:51,000
"I can't believe he stole my fire spear."@g]

53
5425:23:31,000 --> 5492:43:31,000
[g@The thunder god held up a hand.

54
5492:45:11,000 --> 5578:50:11,000
"Shh. The door is opening."@g]

55
5578:51:51,000 --> 5655:26:51,000
The three of them held their breath.

56
5655:28:31,000 --> 5778:11:51,000
When they saw Wukong peek out, they were relieved.

57
5778:13:31,000 --> 5868:46:51,000
"Did you get the ring?" asked the thunder god.

58
5868:48:31,000 --> 6102:55:11,000
"No, but look!" The monkey held up the weapons.

59
6102:56:51,000 --> 6199:38:31,000
"Well done, Wukong!" said the fire god.

60
6199:40:11,000 --> 6355:43:31,000
The thunder god clapped the monkey on the back. "Thank you, Wukong."

61
6355:45:11,000 --> 6423:21:51,000
The warrior held up his sword.

62
6423:23:31,000 --> 6472:03:31,000
[g@"We're all armed.

63
6472:05:11,000 --> 6579:21:51,000
We can easily defeat the demon now."@g]

64
6579:23:31,000 --> 6642:43:31,000
[g@"You're right," said Wukong.

65
6642:45:11,000 --> 6687:10:11,000
He looked around.

66
6687:11:51,000 --> 6759:50:11,000
"Is everyone ready?"@g]

67
6759:51:51,000 --> 6824:13:31,000
"Yes!" said the warrior.

68
6824:15:11,000 --> 6905:00:11,000
"Yes!" said the fire god.

69
6905:01:51,000 --> 7021:48:31,000
"Yes!" said the thunder god.

70
7021:50:11,000 --> 7092:36:51,000
[g@The monkey banged on the cave door.

71
7092:38:31,000 --> 7153:01:51,000
"Wake up, One-Horned Buffalo!@g]

72
7153:03:31,000 --> 7298:31:51,000
Get out here right now or we'll destroy your entire mountain!"

73
7298:33:31,000 --> 7440:25:11,000
[g@The demon stepped outside, yawning.

74
7440:26:51,000 --> 7509:40:11,000
Then he saw the weapons.@g]

75
7509:41:51,000 --> 7592:11:51,000
[g@"How dare you steal from me!"

76
7592:13:31,000 --> 7670:56:51,000
He held up the metal ring.@g]

77
7670:58:31,000 --> 7974:00:11,000
Before anyone could react, the weapons were sucked into it once again.
