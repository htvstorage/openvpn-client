1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,885
"What are we going to do now?" cried Wukong.

2
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:20,926
"One-Horned Buffalo stole all our weapons!"

3
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:23,089
[g@The warrior rubbed his chin.

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,543
He looked very serious.@g]

5
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:28,149
"We can't go back to the Jade Emperor.

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,282
He'll be angry if he finds out we couldn't arrest the demon."

7
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,886
[g@"You're right," said the fire god.

8
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:37,156
"We need a different plan.@g]

9
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:39,835
It's getting dark out, almost nighttime.

10
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:44,360
Maybe one of us can sneak into the cave and steal that metal ring."

11
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:46,249
[g@The thunder god smiled.

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,281
"I know who's perfect for that job."@g]

13
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,358
The others all looked at the god.

14
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:56,814
"One of us is a master thief," the thunder god continued.

15
00:00:56,815 --> 00:01:01,839
"He once stole all the peaches from the Royal Peach Garden."

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,331
Now everyone looked at Wukong.

17
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,365
[g@The monkey pretended to laugh.

18
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:10,394
"Ha-ha. Yes, it's true.@g]

19
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:14,823
I used to steal things, but I know now that stealing is wrong.

20
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:19,857
However, I will steal that metal ring because I need to save the Tang Monk.

21
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:21,669
You all wait here."

22
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,988
The monkey turned himself into a tiny bug and flew into the cave.

23
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:34,093
He went down a long, dark tunnel followed by another tunnel.

24
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,544
Then he heard One-Horned Buffalo.

25
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:40,259
Wukong flew toward the voice.

26
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,795
The demon was sitting on the edge of a bed, talking to himself.

27
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:49,154
The metal ring was still on his arm.

28
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:52,910
"It's time for bed," said the demon with a yawn.

29
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:58,588
"I hope I can eat the Tang Monk tomorrow.

30
00:01:58,589 --> 00:02:05,270
I couldn't eat him today because of that annoying [n@monkey and his friends from Heaven."

31
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:09,292
The demon lay down and was soon asleep.

32
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:13,346
Wukong flew over and landed on the demon's arm.

33
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:16,277
"I'll bite his arm," thought the monkey.

34
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:19,630
"He'll get itchy and have to take off the metal ring."

35
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:23,890
Wukong bit the demon's arm again and again.

36
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:31,286
The demon rolled over and mumbled in his sleep, "Bugs . . . itchy . . ."

37
00:02:31,287 --> 00:02:35,509
He scratched his arm.

38
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,128
Wukong bit him some more.

39
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,150
[g@The demon scratched and scratched.

40
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:43,223
But he didn't take off the metal ring.@g]

41
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:46,299
"This isn't working," thought Wukong.

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,706
He was about to leave the room when he spotted some things in the corner.

43
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:54,073
He gasped. "Our weapons!"

44
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:58,473
Quietly he changed back into himself.

45
00:02:58,474 --> 00:03:02,882
He made his iron bar small and put it in his ear.

46
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:09,182
Then he grabbed the flaming spear, the thunderbolt, and the sword.

47
00:03:09,183 --> 00:03:11,995
Outside the cave the others were waiting.

48
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:14,325
The warrior made a fist.

49
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:17,201
[g@"I hope Wukong steals that metal ring.

50
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:19,972
I am so angry at that demon!"@g]

51
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:22,867
[g@"So am I," said the fire god.

52
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:26,313
"I can't believe he stole my fire spear."@g]

53
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:28,738
[g@The thunder god held up a hand.

54
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,838
"Shh. The door is opening."@g]

55
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,596
The three of them held their breath.

56
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:39,015
When they saw Wukong peek out, they were relieved.

57
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:42,276
"Did you get the ring?" asked the thunder god.

58
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:50,705
"No, but look!" The monkey held up the weapons.

59
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:54,187
"Well done, Wukong!" said the fire god.

60
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:59,806
The thunder god clapped the monkey on the back. "Thank you, Wukong."

61
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,241
The warrior held up his sword.

62
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,994
[g@"We're all armed.

63
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:07,857
We can easily defeat the demon now."@g]

64
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:10,138
[g@"You're right," said Wukong.

65
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,738
He looked around.

66
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,354
"Is everyone ready?"@g]

67
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:16,672
"Yes!" said the warrior.

68
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,580
"Yes!" said the fire god.

69
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:23,785
"Yes!" said the thunder god.

70
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:26,334
[g@The monkey banged on the cave door.

71
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,509
"Wake up, One-Horned Buffalo!@g]

72
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,747
Get out here right now or we'll destroy your entire mountain!"

73
00:04:33,748 --> 00:04:38,855
[g@The demon stepped outside, yawning.

74
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:41,348
Then he saw the weapons.@g]

75
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:44,319
[g@"How dare you steal from me!"

76
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,154
He held up the metal ring.@g]

77
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:58,064
Before anyone could react, the weapons were sucked into it once again.
