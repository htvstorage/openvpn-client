1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:17,219
"Oh no!" Wukong looked at the fan.

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,410
"This fan doesn't work!

3
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:24,043
The Iron Immortal must have tricked me."

4
00:00:24,044 --> 00:00:28,471
The travelers backed away as the fire burned hotter.

5
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:31,207
"What will we do?" asked the Tang Monk.

6
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,956
"We can't go through that fire."

7
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:35,959
Bajie threw his hands up.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,122
"Let's just go home.

9
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:41,770
We'll write a letter to Buddha explaining what happened."

10
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:46,277
"Bajie, we can't do that!" the Tang Monk scolded.

11
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:48,125
Wukong spoke up.

12
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:52,333
"I used to be friends with the Iron Immortal's husband, the Bull Demon King.

13
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:55,720
I have an idea."

14
00:00:55,721 --> 00:01:00,132
The Iron Immortal was in her cave when she heard a knock.

15
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:07,589
"Oh no," she said to herself. "That monkey is back."

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,939
She walked quietly to the door and peeked outside.

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,964
When she saw the Bull Demon King, she smiled and opened the door.

18
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:22,250
"I'm glad you're back," said the Iron Immortal.

19
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:25,299
"Sun Wukong was here."

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,239
"I used to be friends with him."

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,090
The demon smiled.

22
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:32,925
"It would have been nice to see him again."

23
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,992
His wife was confused.

24
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:36,763
"What do you mean?

25
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:40,489
You told me that you never really liked him."

26
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,848
"Oh, really?" said the demon.

27
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:47,094
"He was very rude," said the woman.

28
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:50,571
"He demanded I let him borrow my fan."

29
00:01:50,572 --> 00:01:54,888
"You didn't give it to him, did you?" asked the demon.

30
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:57,697
"Of course not," said his wife.

31
00:01:57,698 --> 00:02:03,539
"I gave him a fake fan that looks just like the real one."

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,426
The demon began pacing.

33
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:13,851
"Wukong is very smart and very powerful," he said.

34
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:17,754
"He'll realize you tricked him, and then he'll come back here."

35
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:21,023
"What should we do?" asked the Iron Immortal.

36
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:23,728
"Give me the fan," said the demon.

37
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:28,568
"I'll keep it safe."

38
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:37,725
The Iron Immortal opened a chest and took out the fan.

39
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:40,826
She handed it to her husband.

40
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:46,773
Suddenly light sparkled and Wukong stood in front of her.

41
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:49,583
"I tricked you!"

42
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:54,504
The monkey laughed and ran out of the cave.

43
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:59,356
The Iron Immortal stamped her foot. "Ugh!"

44
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:03,109
She was still angry when her husband came home.

45
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,545
"Hello, dear," said the Bull Demon King with a big smile.

46
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:11,213
But then his smile faded. "What's wrong?"

47
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:15,312
"Your friend Sun Wukong was here!" she snapped.

48
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:18,322
"He's not my friend!" said the demon.

49
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:23,115
"Even before he defeated Red Boy, I never really liked him."

50
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:27,561
"Well, you'll like him even less now," said the Iron Immortal.

51
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:30,110
"He stole my fan!"

52
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:32,293
The demon looked surprised.

53
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:35,816
"That fan's wind magic is powerful.

54
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:38,347
How did the monkey steal it?"

55
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:42,089
"He tricked me into giving it to him," said his wife.

56
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,861
"He made himself look like you."

57
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:46,831
The demon's face turned red.

58
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:48,853
"How dare he do that!"

59
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,752
He took a deep breath.

60
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:54,745
"Don't worry. I will find that rotten monkey.

61
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:58,219
I'll get your fan back!"

62
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,299
The Bull Demon King stomped out of the cave.

63
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,839
Wukong walked along the road, carrying the plantain-leaf fan.

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,093
He was still laughing about how he'd tricked the Iron Immortal.

65
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:15,071
Then he saw Bajie approaching.

66
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:20,661
"Bajie!" cried Wukong. "What are you doing here?"

67
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:24,136
"I was coming to help you," said the pig.

68
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:26,971
"Thanks, but I don't need help."

69
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:28,963
Wukong held up the fan.

70
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:33,154
"I tricked the Iron Immortal and got the real fan this time."

71
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:37,043
"Good!" said Bajie. "I can carry it for you."

72
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:41,427
"Thanks," said Wukong as he handed the fan to Bajie.

73
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:44,674
The monkey patted his friend on the shoulder.

74
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:47,718
"Now let's get back to Master. We need toâ€”"

75
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:50,393
Suddenly there was a flash of light.

76
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:55,394
A second later the Bull Demon King stood next to Wukong.

77
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,524
The demon laughed.

78
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:00,688
"I tricked you, Wukong!"

79
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:08,797
There was another flash and the demon was gone.
