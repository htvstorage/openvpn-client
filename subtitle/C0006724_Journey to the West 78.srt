"Oh no!" Wukong looked at the fan.

2
174:38:30,933.3329999446869 --> 263:15:10,933.3329999446869
[g@"This fan doesn't work!

263:16:50,933.3329999446869 --> 364:10:10,933.3329999446869
The Iron Immortal must have tricked me."@g]

4
364:11:50,933.3329999446869 --> 487:10:10,933.3329999446869
The travelers backed away as the fire burned hotter.

5
487:11:50,933.3329999446869 --> 563:10:10,933.3329999446869
[g@"What will we do?" asked the Tang Monk.

6
563:11:50,933.3329999446869 --> 639:31:50,933.3330001831055
"We can't go through that fire."@g]

7
639:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 695:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie threw his hands up.

8
695:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 755:15:10,933.3330001831055
"Let's just go home.@g]

9
755:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 856:35:10,933.3330001831055
We'll write a letter to Buddha explaining what happened."

10
856:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 981:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Bajie, we can't do that!" the Tang Monk scolded.

11
981:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1033:06:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong spoke up.

12
1033:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1150:00:10,933.3330001831055
"I used to be friends with the Iron Immortal's husband, the Bull Demon King.

13
1150:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1244:05:10,933.3330001831055
I have an idea."

14
1244:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1366:38:30,933.3330001831055
The Iron Immortal was in her cave when she heard a knock.

15
1366:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1573:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Oh no," she said to herself. "That monkey is back."

16
1573:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1722:23:30,933.3330001831055
She walked quietly to the door and peeked outside.

17
1722:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1889:45:10,933.3330001831055
When she saw the Bull Demon King, she smiled and opened the door.

18
1889:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1981:01:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"I'm glad you're back," said the Iron Immortal.

19
1981:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2065:43:30,933.3330001831055
"Sun Wukong was here."@g]

20
2065:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2119:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"I used to be friends with him."

2119:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2171:01:50,933.3330001831055
The demon smiled.@g]

22
2171:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2277:33:30,933.3330001831055
"It would have been nice to see him again."

23
2277:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2334:58:30,933.3330001831055
His wife was confused.

24
2335:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2384:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"What do you mean?

25
2384:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2487:40:10,933.3330001831055
You told me that you never really liked him."@g]

26
2487:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2580:58:30,933.3330001831055
"Oh, really?" said the demon.

27
2581:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2671:08:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"He was very rude," said the woman.

28
2671:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2767:43:30,933.3330001831055
"He demanded I let him borrow my fan."@g]

29
2767:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2887:38:30,933.3330001831055
"You didn't give it to him, did you?" asked the demon.

30
2887:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2965:40:10,933.3330001831055
"Of course not," said his wife.

31
2965:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3127:56:50,933.3330001831055
"I gave him a fake fan that looks just like the real one."

32
3127:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3263:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The demon began pacing.

33
3263:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3414:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Wukong is very smart and very powerful," he said.@g]

34
3414:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3522:48:30,933.3330001831055
"He'll realize you tricked him, and then he'll come back here."

35
3522:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3613:36:50,933.3330001831055
"What should we do?" asked the Iron Immortal.

36
3613:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3688:45:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Give me the fan," said the demon.

37
3688:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3823:11:50,933.3330001831055
"I'll keep it safe."@g]

38
3823:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4077:33:30,933.3330001831055
The Iron Immortal opened a chest and took out the fan.

39
4077:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4163:41:50,933.3330001831055
She handed it to her husband.

40
4163:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4328:53:30,933.3330001831055
Suddenly light sparkled and Wukong stood in front of her.

41
4328:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4406:56:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"I tricked you!"

42
4406:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4543:38:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey laughed and ran out of the cave.@g]

43
4543:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4678:25:10,933.3330001831055
The Iron Immortal stamped her foot. "Ugh!"

44
4678:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4782:40:10,933.3330001831055
She was still angry when her husband came home.

45
4782:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4905:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Hello, dear," said the Bull Demon King with a big smile.

46
4905:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5007:46:50,933.3330001831055
But then his smile faded. "What's wrong?"

47
5007:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5121:38:30,933.3330001831055
"Your friend Sun Wukong was here!" she snapped.

48
5121:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5205:15:10,933.3330001831055
"He's not my friend!" said the demon.

49
5205:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5338:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Even before he defeated Red Boy, I never really liked him."

50
5338:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5461:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Well, you'll like him even less now," said the Iron Immortal.

51
5461:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5532:41:50,933.3330001831055
"He stole my fan!"

52
5532:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5593:20:10,933.3330001831055
The demon looked surprised.

53
5593:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5691:11:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"That fan's wind magic is powerful.

5691:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5761:30:10,933.3330001831055
How did the monkey steal it?"@g]

55
5761:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5865:26:50,933.3330001831055
"He tricked me into giving it to him," said his wife.

56
5865:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5942:26:50,933.3330001831055
"He made himself look like you."

57
5942:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5997:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The demon's face turned red.

58
5997:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6053:20:10,933.3330001831055
"How dare he do that!"

59
6053:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6106:05:10,933.3330001831055
He took a deep breath.@g]

60
6106:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6217:00:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Don't worry. I will find that rotten monkey.

6217:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6313:30:10,933.3330001831055
I'll get your fan back!"@g]

62
6313:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6454:36:50,933.3330001831055
The Bull Demon King stomped out of the cave.

63
6454:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6580:43:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong walked along the road, carrying the plantain-leaf fan.

64
6580:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6698:53:30,933.3330001831055
He was still laughing about how he'd tricked the Iron Immortal.

65
6698:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6781:36:50,933.3330001831055
Then he saw Bajie approaching.

66
6781:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6936:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Bajie!" cried Wukong. "What are you doing here?"

67
6936:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7033:25:10,933.3330001831055
"I was coming to help you," said the pig.

68
7033:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7112:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Thanks, but I don't need help."

69
7112:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7167:30:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong held up the fan.@g]

70
7167:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7283:55:10,933.3330001831055
"I tricked the Iron Immortal and got the real fan this time."

71
7283:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7391:56:50,933.3330001831055
"Good!" said Bajie. "I can carry it for you."

72
7391:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7513:43:30,933.3330001831055
"Thanks," said Wukong as he handed the fan to Bajie.

73
7513:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7603:55:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey patted his friend on the shoulder.

74
7603:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7688:28:30,933.3330001831055
"Now let's get back to Master. We need toâ€”"

7688:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7762:46:50,933.3330001831055
Suddenly there was a flash of light.

76
7762:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7901:41:50,933.3330001831055
A second later the Bull Demon King stood next to Wukong.

77
7901:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7960:51:50,933.3330001831055

8048:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8274:00:10,933.3330001831055
There was another flash and the demon was gone.
