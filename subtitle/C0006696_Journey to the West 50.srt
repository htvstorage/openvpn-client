1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,443
Wukong and his companions ran back down the mountain, escaping the fire.

2
00:00:21,444 --> 00:00:24,942
"Red Boy's fire is powerful," said the monkey.

3
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:28,455
"We were nearly roasted!" said Bajie.

4
00:00:28,456 --> 00:00:31,759
Wujing looked up at the mountain peak.

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,804
"The fire is dying down now."

6
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:40,469
"Yes," said Wukong, looking at the last few wisps of smoke.

7
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,748
"But he'll use it again if we go back up there."

8
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:46,586
"We need water," said Wujing.

9
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:50,693
"Then if he makes fire again, we can just put it out."

10
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:53,706
Wukong nodded. "You two wait here.

11
00:00:53,707 --> 00:00:56,776
I know who can help us."

12
00:00:56,777 --> 00:01:02,642
The monkey shot into the air and flew away.

13
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:08,152
When he returned, the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea was with him.

14
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:12,789
Wukong introduced the Dragon King to Bajie and Wujing.

15
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,992
"I can summon rain clouds," said the Dragon King.

16
00:01:17,993 --> 00:01:22,257
"Go back up the mountain, and get Red Boy to come out.

17
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:28,287
As soon as he makes his fire, I'll create a huge rainstorm."

18
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:32,909
The Dragon King flew up into the sky.

19
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,013
Wukong and the others returned to the cave.

20
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:38,061
"Open up, Red Boy!"

21
00:01:38,062 --> 00:01:41,613
The monkey pounded on the cave door.

22
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:45,742
The door flew open and Red Boy ran outside.

23
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:50,405
"Release the Tang Monk right now!" shouted Wukong.

24
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:53,288
"Never!" shouted the demon.

25
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:57,580
He made a fist and punched himself in the nose.

26
00:01:57,581 --> 00:02:02,717
Smoke and fire poured from his face again.

27
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:08,124
"Dragon King!" called the monkey. "Make it rain!"

28
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:11,841
Thunder rumbled as dark clouds filled the sky.

29
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:13,615
Rain poured down.

30
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:17,633
The fire, however, didn't go out.

31
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:20,840
Instead it grewâ€”bigger and bigger.

32
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,743
The smoke became thick.

33
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:27,402
Coughing and unable to breathe, Wukong covered his face.

34
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:31,183
He saw Bajie and Wujing running away.

35
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:35,869
The monkey tried to get to the cave door, but the smoke was too thick.

36
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:43,037
He tripped on a rock and tumbled down the side of the mountain.

37
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:52,291
Splash! Wukong landed in a river and floated downstream.

38
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:58,788
Finally he washed up on the riverbank, coughing and wheezing.

39
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:02,103
Bajie and Wujing rushed over to the monkey.

40
00:03:02,104 --> 00:03:06,004
"Wukong, are you all right?" asked Wujing.

41
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:08,661
"I think so," said the monkey.

42
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:10,888
He coughed again.

43
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:13,656
"That fire is no ordinary fire.

44
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:16,180
The water made it worse."

45
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,259
"You're right," said the pig.

46
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,312
"It must be magic fire.

47
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:22,655
What will we do now?

48
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:27,299
Red Boy still has the Tang Monk in his cave."

49
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,376
"I'll ask Guanyin for help," said Wukong, standing up.

50
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,823
"You rest," said Bajie.

51
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:35,750
"You breathed in a lot of smoke.

52
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,911
I'll go to Guanyin."

53
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:40,292
The monkey coughed again.

54
00:03:40,293 --> 00:03:49,249
"Okay, Bajie. But go straight to Guanyin. No naps!"

55
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,477
Meanwhile Red Boy was sitting on his mountain peak.

56
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:58,673
"My fire was too powerful for Sun Wukong and his friends," he said to himself.

57
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:01,403
"They must be dead now."

58
00:04:01,404 --> 00:04:03,912
The demon patted his belly.

59
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:07,641
"And that is good because I am hungry.

60
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:11,602
I'll go inside now and start cooking the Tang Monk."

61
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:17,600
The demon stood up to leave when he spotted something in the sky.

62
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:19,902
"It's the pig!" he said.

63
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:22,357
"He's heading south.

64
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:25,068
I wonder why."

65
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,250
Red Boy thought for a minute.

66
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:34,988
"Aha! The bodhisattva Guanyin lives on Mount Potalaka, in the South Sea.

67
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:38,152
The pig must be going to ask her for help.

68
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,624
I'll stop him!"

69
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:45,883
The demon recited a quick spell, and light sparkled around him.

70
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:51,252
Now Red Boy looked exactly like Guanyin.

71
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:58,164
Bajie soared through the sky on his cloud.

72
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,704
He saw Guanyin coming toward him.

73
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:05,434
"Bodhisattva!" cried the pig with a smile.

74
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:06,945
"This is a surprise.

75
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:13,453
I was just coming to see you!"
