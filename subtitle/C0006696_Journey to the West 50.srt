1
00:00:11,000 --> 290:05:11,000
Wukong and his companions ran back down the mountain, escaping the fire.

2
290:06:51,000 --> 387:16:51,000
"Red Boy's fire is powerful," said the monkey.

3
387:18:31,000 --> 484:51:51,000
"We were nearly roasted!" said Bajie.

4
484:53:31,000 --> 576:38:31,000
[g@Wujing looked up at the mountain peak.

5
576:40:11,000 --> 661:13:31,000
"The fire is dying down now."@g]

6
661:15:11,000 --> 818:35:11,000
"Yes," said Wukong, looking at the last few wisps of smoke.

7
818:36:51,000 --> 909:40:11,000
"But he'll use it again if we go back up there."

8
909:41:51,000 --> 988:30:11,000
"We need water," said Wujing.

9
988:31:51,000 --> 1102:35:11,000
"Then if he makes fire again, we can just put it out."

10
1102:36:51,000 --> 1186:16:51,000
[g@Wukong nodded. "You two wait here.

11
1186:18:31,000 --> 1271:33:31,000
I know who can help us."@g]

12
1271:35:11,000 --> 1434:30:11,000
The monkey shot into the air and flew away.

13
1434:31:51,000 --> 1587:33:31,000
When he returned, the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea was with him.

14
1587:35:11,000 --> 1716:21:51,000
Wukong introduced the Dragon King to Bajie and Wujing.

15
1716:23:31,000 --> 1860:53:31,000
"I can summon rain clouds," said the Dragon King.

16
1860:55:11,000 --> 1979:21:51,000
"Go back up the mountain, and get Red Boy to come out.

17
1979:23:31,000 --> 2146:51:51,000
As soon as he makes his fire, I'll create a huge rainstorm."

18
2146:53:31,000 --> 2275:15:11,000
The Dragon King flew up into the sky.

19
2275:16:51,000 --> 2361:28:31,000
Wukong and the others returned to the cave.

20
2361:30:11,000 --> 2418:21:51,000
[g@"Open up, Red Boy!"

21
2418:23:31,000 --> 2517:01:51,000
The monkey pounded on the cave door.@g]

22
2517:03:31,000 --> 2631:43:31,000
The door flew open and Red Boy ran outside.

23
2631:45:11,000 --> 2761:15:11,000
"Release the Tang Monk right now!" shouted Wukong.

24
2761:16:51,000 --> 2841:20:11,000
"Never!" shouted the demon.

25
2841:21:51,000 --> 2960:33:31,000
He made a fist and punched himself in the nose.

26
2960:35:11,000 --> 3103:15:11,000
Smoke and fire poured from his face again.

27
3103:16:51,000 --> 3253:26:51,000
"Dragon King!" called the monkey. "Make it rain!"

28
3253:28:31,000 --> 3356:41:51,000
[g@Thunder rumbled as dark clouds filled the sky.

29
3356:43:31,000 --> 3405:58:31,000
Rain poured down.@g]

30
3406:00:11,000 --> 3517:35:11,000
The fire, however, didn't go out.

31
3517:36:51,000 --> 3606:40:11,000
[g@Instead it grewâ€”bigger and bigger.

32
3606:41:51,000 --> 3659:31:51,000
The smoke became thick.@g]

33
3659:33:31,000 --> 3788:56:51,000
Coughing and unable to breathe, Wukong covered his face.

34
3788:58:31,000 --> 3893:58:31,000
He saw Bajie and Wujing running away.

35
3894:00:11,000 --> 4024:08:31,000
The monkey tried to get to the cave door, but the smoke was too thick.

36
4024:10:11,000 --> 4223:15:11,000
He tripped on a rock and tumbled down the side of the mountain.

37
4223:16:51,000 --> 4480:18:31,000
[i@Splash!@i] Wukong landed in a river and floated downstream.

38
4480:20:11,000 --> 4660:46:51,000
Finally he washed up on the riverbank, coughing and wheezing.

39
4660:48:31,000 --> 4752:51:51,000
Bajie and Wujing rushed over to the monkey.

40
4752:53:31,000 --> 4861:13:31,000
"Wukong, are you all right?" asked Wujing.

41
4861:15:11,000 --> 4935:01:51,000
[g@"I think so," said the monkey.

42
4935:03:31,000 --> 4996:53:31,000
He coughed again.@g]

43
4996:55:11,000 --> 5073:46:51,000
[g@"That fire is no ordinary fire.

44
5073:48:31,000 --> 5143:53:31,000
The water made it worse."@g]

45
5143:55:11,000 --> 5201:38:31,000
"You're right," said the pig.

46
5201:40:11,000 --> 5258:40:11,000
"It must be magic fire.

47
5258:41:51,000 --> 5323:45:11,000
[g@What will we do now?

48
5323:46:51,000 --> 5452:45:11,000
Red Boy still has the Tang Monk in his cave."@g]

49
5452:46:51,000 --> 5566:00:11,000
"I'll ask Guanyin for help," said Wukong, standing up.

50
5566:01:51,000 --> 5633:58:31,000
"You rest," said Bajie.

51
5634:00:11,000 --> 5687:30:11,000
[g@"You breathed in a lot of smoke.

52
5687:31:51,000 --> 5747:31:51,000
I'll go to Guanyin."@g]

53
5747:33:31,000 --> 5813:40:11,000
The monkey coughed again.

54
5813:41:51,000 --> 6062:28:31,000
"Okay, Bajie. But go straight to Guanyin. No naps!"

55
6062:30:11,000 --> 6179:55:11,000
Meanwhile Red Boy was sitting on his mountain peak.

56
6179:56:51,000 --> 6324:15:11,000
"My fire was too powerful for Sun Wukong and his friends," he said to himself.

57
6324:16:51,000 --> 6400:05:11,000
"They must be dead now."

58
6400:06:51,000 --> 6469:46:51,000
[g@The demon patted his belly.

59
6469:48:31,000 --> 6573:21:51,000
"And that is good because I am hungry.@g]

60
6573:23:31,000 --> 6683:23:31,000
I'll go inside now and start cooking the Tang Monk."

61
6683:25:11,000 --> 6850:00:11,000
The demon stood up to leave when he spotted something in the sky.

62
6850:01:51,000 --> 6913:56:51,000
"It's the pig!" he said.

63
6913:58:31,000 --> 6982:08:31,000
[g@"He's heading south.

64
6982:10:11,000 --> 7057:26:51,000
I wonder why."@g]

65
7057:28:31,000 --> 7145:50:11,000
Red Boy thought for a minute.

66
7145:51:51,000 --> 7333:00:11,000
"Aha! The bodhisattva Guanyin lives on Mount Potalaka, in the South Sea.

67
7333:01:51,000 --> 7420:53:31,000
[g@The pig must be going to ask her for help.

68
7420:55:11,000 --> 7489:33:31,000
I'll stop him!"@g]

69
7489:35:11,000 --> 7635:38:31,000
The demon recited a quick spell, and light sparkled around him.

70
7635:40:11,000 --> 7784:46:51,000
Now Red Boy looked exactly like Guanyin.

71
7784:48:31,000 --> 7976:46:51,000
Bajie soared through the sky on his cloud.

72
7976:48:31,000 --> 8047:20:11,000
He saw Guanyin coming toward him.

73
8047:21:51,000 --> 8178:43:31,000
"Bodhisattva!" cried the pig with a smile.

74
8178:45:11,000 --> 8220:41:51,000
[g@"This is a surprise.

75
8220:43:31,000 --> 8401:28:31,000
I was just coming to see you!"@g]
