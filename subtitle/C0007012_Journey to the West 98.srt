1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:17,277
Wukong and his companions walked on the mountain road.

2
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,796
The monkey watched carefully for the monster and demons.

3
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:27,778
Suddenly a demon charged toward the group.

4
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,519
"Stay here, everyone!" shouted Bajie.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,925
"I'll fight this demon!"

6
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:36,542
The pig swung his rake.

7
00:00:36,543 --> 00:00:41,879
The demon stepped off the road and headed down the slope of the mountain.

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,851
Bajie raced after the demon and was soon out of sight.

9
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:50,848
Wukong heard grunts and clashing weapons.

10
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:53,596
But he couldn't see the fight.

11
00:00:53,597 --> 00:00:59,766
A moment later the demon climbed back onto the road.

12
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:02,468
"Stay here, Wujing!" shouted Wukong.

13
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:04,966
"Protect the Tang Monk!"

14
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:07,960
The monkey charged toward the demon.

15
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:11,452
Clang! Their weapons clashed.

16
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:15,966
Wukong fought with all his strength.

17
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:19,785
Again the demon left the road and headed down the mountain.

18
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:21,858
Wukong chased him.

19
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:26,528
The monkey and the demon disappeared down the slope of the mountain.

20
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:31,264
"Do you think Wukong can defeat that demon?" asked the Tang Monk nervously.

21
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,662
"Definitely," said Wujing.

22
00:01:33,663 --> 00:01:36,071
"I wonder what happened to Bajie though.

23
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:39,334
I hope he's okay."

24
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:42,369
Suddenly the demon was back.

25
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,966
Wujing was shocked.

26
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:46,487
"How did you get past Wukong?"

27
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:51,817
Without waiting for an answer, Wujing raised his spear and attacked the demon.

28
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:55,378
The two fought, kicking up dust and rocks.

29
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,661
Wujing struck the demon across the legs.

30
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:01,884
The demon tumbled down the mountainside.

31
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:04,309
Wujing ran after him.

32
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,130
The Tang Monk stood in the road.

33
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:10,245
For a moment everything was quiet.

34
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:13,071
Then he heard footsteps behind him.

35
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:16,779
The monk turned around and gasped.

36
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,728
A huge, fat monster was smiling wickedly at him.

37
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:27,642
When Wukong returned to the road, he found Bajie alone.

38
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:30,220
The pig looked upset.

39
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:33,985
"Where are Master and Wujing?" asked the monkey.

40
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:36,337
Bajie scratched his head.

41
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:37,705
"I don't know.

42
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:41,035
I defeated that demon and then came back here.

43
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:44,339
Everyone was gone."

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,748
"You didn't defeat the demon," said Wukong.

45
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:49,605
"He got past you.

46
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:52,963
He came back here, and I had to fight him."

47
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,890
"What!" shouted Bajie. "You're crazy!

48
00:02:56,891 --> 00:03:00,855
I was fighting with the demon until just a few moments ago!"

49
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:02,865
Wukong scoffed.

50
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:05,880
"Do you really expect me to believe that?

51
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:09,004
I was just fighting with the demon!"

52
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:12,718
Wujing returned to the road, annoyed.

53
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,071
"How did that demon get past you two?

54
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,344
He wasn't that powerful."

55
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:19,791
Wukong was confused.

56
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:22,207
"The demon didn't get past me.

57
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,870
I was fighting with him until just a moment ago."

58
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,644
"That's impossible," said Wujing.

59
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:33,081
"After you chased him down the slope, he returned and—

60
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:35,572
Where's Master?"

61
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:37,581
Wukong made a fist.

62
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:40,206
"How could we be so stupid?

63
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:42,506
There wasn't just one demon.

64
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:44,392
There were three!

65
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:47,452
They lured us away, one by one.

66
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:53,497
Then another demon—probably that fat monster—grabbed Master while we were gone."

67
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:56,731
Bajie fumed. "You're right!"

68
00:03:56,732 --> 00:04:00,316
"That monster must have a cave nearby," said Wujing.

69
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,050
"Let's find it."

70
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:07,458
The three companions searched the mountain.

71
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,382
They soon found a cave.

72
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,880
Its door was shut.

73
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:15,454
"Do you think this is the monster's cave?" asked Wujing.

74
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,213
"We'll find out," said Bajie.

75
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:22,192
He raised his rake and knocked a hole in the door.

76
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:27,979
Then he shouted into the hole, "Release the Tang Monk!"

77
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,395
A demon inside the cave shrieked and ran into a kitchen.

78
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:36,333
The monster was grinding spices with a mortar and pestle.

79
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:39,403
"That pig is here!" cried the demon.

80
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,877
The monster kept grinding.

81
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:46,271
"Who cares? I'm only afraid of Wukong."

82
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:50,299
"I'm here too!" shouted Wukong through the hole.

83
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,380
The monster dropped the mortar and pestle. "Uh-oh."

84
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:57,746
He thought for a moment.

85
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:02,281
Then he cleared his throat and shouted, "You're too late!

86
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:09,635
We already ate the Tang Monk!"
