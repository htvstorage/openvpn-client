1
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:19,548
Monkey splashed through the waterfall and landed in a large cave.

2
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:21,639
His eyes opened wide.

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,301
The cave was filled with bamboo, trees, and beautiful flowers.

4
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:30,924
Moss covered the walls.

5
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:37,794
A stream flowed through the cave, and glowing light and mist filled the air.

6
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:42,315
Monkey found a long table with bowls, cups, and plates.

7
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:46,540
A fireplace sat against one wall.

8
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:51,834
Deeper in the cave, Monkey found bedrooms with cozy beds.

9
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:56,673
Outside, the other monkeys and apes were looking at the waterfall.

10
00:00:56,674 --> 00:01:00,244
"Do you think he made it through?" asked one monkey.

11
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:03,164
"No," said another monkey.

12
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:07,863
"He probably got washed away down the river."

13
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:16,345
Suddenly—splash! Monkey shot out of the waterfall and landed in front of the group.

14
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:19,124
"You're alive!" said a monkey.

15
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:24,652
Monkey laughed. "Yes! And we are very lucky!

16
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:29,125
I found a perfect home for all of us. Follow me!"

17
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:32,921
Monkey jumped back through the water.

18
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:35,888
Some of the monkeys scratched their heads.

19
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:40,703
"It still looks dangerous," said one monkey.

20
00:01:40,704 --> 00:01:43,169
"Let's go," said the gibbon.

21
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,718
He leaped through the waterfall.

22
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,642
After that, another monkey jumped through.

23
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:54,927
Then some more jumped.

24
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:58,796
Soon all of the monkeys and apes were in the cave.

25
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:03,887
Everyone ran around to see all the wonderful things.

26
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:06,855
"This cave is beautiful," said the gibbon.

27
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:10,831
Some of the monkeys and apes began fighting and arguing.

28
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:14,243
They grabbed plates and bowls from one another.

29
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:17,412
Others fought over the bedrooms.

30
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:21,063
"I saw this bed first!" yelled one monkey.

31
00:02:21,064 --> 00:02:25,049
"No!" yelled another monkey. "I did!"

32
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,860
Monkey watched his friends for a moment and then folded his arms.

33
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:32,269
"Ahem!" he called.

34
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,453
All the monkeys and apes stopped what they were doing.

35
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:37,628
They looked at Monkey.

36
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:41,092
"I found this cave for us," said Monkey.

37
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:43,130
"That means I am now your king.

38
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:45,342
Why aren't you bowing to me?"

39
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:47,780
"He's right," said the gibbon.

40
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:52,555
He bowed to Monkey and said, "All hail the Monkey King."

41
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,979
Everyone else bowed too.

42
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:03,362
"All hail the Monkey King!" they shouted.

43
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,847
Many years went by.

44
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:10,440
During the day the monkeys and apes played in the forest and the stream.

45
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:14,886
And every night they slept safely in their cave.

46
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:18,805
One night the monkeys and apes had a huge feast.

47
00:03:18,806 --> 00:03:21,614
Fruits and nuts covered the table.

48
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:26,155
Monkeys and apes danced and sang while music played.

49
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:29,405
Monkey sat on his throne and smiled.

50
00:03:29,406 --> 00:03:31,757
But then his smile faded.

51
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:33,973
Soon he was frowning.

52
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:38,936
The gibbon saw Monkey and rushed over.

53
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:41,371
"Your Majesty," said the gibbon.

54
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:44,534
"You look sad. What's wrong?"

55
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:48,936
Monkey sighed. "Our life here is perfect."

56
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,393
"Yes, that's true," said the gibbon.

57
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:53,580
"So why are you sad?"

58
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:56,244
Monkey was quiet for a moment.

59
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:59,406
Then he said, "Someday our lives will end.

60
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,278
I wish this perfect life could last forever."

61
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:04,455
The gibbon's eyes lit up.

62
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:08,470
"Oh," he said. "You want to live forever?"

63
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:10,986
"I do," said Monkey.

64
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:13,500
The gibbon rubbed his chin.

65
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:16,196
"Then you must study with a sage.

66
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:19,786
Sages are very wise people.

67
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:22,832
They can turn themselves into other animals.

68
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,569
They can fly through the sky.

69
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,232
And they know how to live forever."

70
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,751
Monkey smiled again.

71
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:34,878
"Where can I find a sage?" he asked.

72
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,449
"You must find a land with people," said the gibbon.

73
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,198
"That's where you'll find a sage."

74
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:48,217
The next morning Monkey built a raft and loaded food onto it.

75
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:52,102
He pushed the raft into the stream and jumped on.

76
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:57,259
As the raft began to float away, Monkey waved to his friends.

77
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,529
"Don't worry!" he called.

78
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:07,340
"After I learn how to live forever, I will return!"
