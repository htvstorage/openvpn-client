00:00:11,050.66700000000128 --> 236:01:51,050.66700005531311
Monkey splashed through the waterfall and landed in a large cave.

2
236:03:31,050.66700005531311 --> 294:06:51,050.66700005531311
His eyes opened wide.

3
294:08:31,050.66700005531311 --> 451:23:31,050.66700005531311
The cave was filled with bamboo, trees, and beautiful flowers.

4
451:25:11,050.66700005531311 --> 552:01:51,050.66700005531311
Moss covered the walls.

5
552:03:31,050.66700005531311 --> 742:51:51,050.66699981689453
A stream flowed through the cave, and glowing light and mist filled the air.

6
742:53:31,050.66699981689453 --> 868:26:51,050.66699981689453
Monkey found a long table with bowls, cups, and plates.

7
868:28:31,050.66699981689453 --> 985:48:31,050.66699981689453
A fireplace sat against one wall.

8
985:50:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1132:51:51,050.66699981689453
Deeper in the cave, Monkey found bedrooms with cozy beds.

9
1132:53:31,050.66699981689453 --> 1267:16:51,050.66699981689453
Outside, the other monkeys and apes were looking at the waterfall.

10
1267:18:31,050.66699981689453 --> 1366:28:31,050.66699981689453
"Do you think he made it through?" asked one monkey.

11
1366:30:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1447:35:11,050.66699981689453
[g@"No," said another monkey.

12
1447:36:51,050.66699981689453 --> 1578:06:51,050.66699981689453
"He probably got washed away down the river."@g]

13
1578:08:31,050.66699981689453 --> 1813:43:31,050.66699981689453
Suddenlyâ€”[i@splash!@i] Monkey shot out of the waterfall [n@and landed in front of the group.

14
1813:45:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1890:55:11,050.66699981689453
"You're alive!" said a monkey.

15
1890:56:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2044:28:31,050.66699981689453
Monkey laughed. "Yes! And we are very lucky!

16
2044:30:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2168:43:31,050.66699981689453
I found a perfect home for all of us. Follow me!"

17
2168:45:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2274:10:11,050.66699981689453
Monkey jumped back through the water.

18
2274:11:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2356:35:11,050.66699981689453
Some of the monkeys scratched their heads.

19
2356:36:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2490:20:11,050.66699981689453
"It still looks dangerous," said one monkey.

20
2490:21:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2558:50:11,050.66699981689453
[g@"Let's go," said the gibbon.

21
2558:51:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2629:38:31,050.66699981689453
He leaped through the waterfall.@g]

22
2629:40:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2766:25:11,050.66699981689453
[g@After that, another monkey jumped through.

23
2766:26:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2885:26:51,050.66699981689453
Then some more jumped.@g]

24
2885:28:31,050.66699981689453 --> 2992:55:11,050.66699981689453
Soon all of the monkeys and apes were in the cave.

25
2992:56:51,050.66699981689453 --> 3134:20:11,050.66699981689453
Everyone ran around to see all the wonderful things.

26
3134:21:51,050.66699981689453 --> 3216:46:51,050.66699981689453
"This cave is beautiful," said the gibbon.

27
3216:48:31,050.66699981689453 --> 3327:13:31,050.66699981689453
Some of the monkeys and apes began fighting and arguing.

28
3327:15:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3422:00:11,050.66699981689453
They grabbed plates and bowls from one another.

29
3422:01:51,050.66699981689453 --> 3510:01:51,050.66699981689453
Others fought over the bedrooms.

30
3510:03:31,050.66699981689453 --> 3611:26:51,050.66699981689453
"I saw this bed first!" yelled one monkey.

31
3611:28:31,050.66699981689453 --> 3722:10:11,050.66699981689453
"No!" yelled another monkey. "I did!"

32
3722:11:51,050.66699981689453 --> 3855:48:31,050.66699981689453
Monkey watched his friends for a moment and then folded his arms.

33
3855:50:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3922:43:31,050.66699981689453
"Ahem!" he called.

34
3922:45:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4011:10:11,050.66699981689453
All the monkeys and apes stopped what they were doing.

35
4011:11:51,050.66699981689453 --> 4071:35:11,050.66699981689453
They looked at Monkey.

36
4071:36:51,050.66699981689453 --> 4167:48:31,050.66699981689453
"I found this cave for us," said Monkey.

37
4167:50:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4224:25:11,050.66699981689453
[g@"That means I am now your king.

38
4224:26:51,050.66699981689453 --> 4285:51:51,050.66699981689453
Why aren't you bowing to me?"@g]

39
4285:53:31,050.66699981689453 --> 4353:35:11,050.66699981689453
"He's right," said the gibbon.

40
4353:36:51,050.66699981689453 --> 4486:13:31,050.66699981689453
He bowed to Monkey and said, "All hail the Monkey King."

41
4486:15:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4553:33:31,050.66699981689453
[g@Everyone else bowed too.

42
4553:35:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4786:25:11,050.66699981689453
"All hail the Monkey King!" they shouted.@g]

43
4786:26:51,050.66699981689453 --> 4855:26:51,050.66699981689453
Many years went by.

44
4855:28:31,050.66699981689453 --> 4983:01:51,050.66699981689453
During the day the monkeys and apes played in the forest and the stream.

45
4983:03:31,050.66699981689453 --> 5106:31:51,050.66699981689453
And every night they slept safely in their cave.

46
5106:33:31,050.66699981689453 --> 5215:23:31,050.66699981689453
One night the monkeys and apes had a huge feast.

47
5215:25:11,050.66699981689453 --> 5293:25:11,050.66699981689453
Fruits and nuts covered the table.

48
5293:26:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5419:33:31,050.66699981689453
Monkeys and apes danced and sang while music played.

49
5419:35:11,050.66699981689453 --> 5509:50:11,050.66699981689453
[g@Monkey sat on his throne and smiled.

50
5509:51:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5575:10:11,050.66699981689453
But then his smile faded.@g]

51
5575:11:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5636:43:31,050.66699981689453
Soon he was frowning.

52
5636:45:11,050.66699981689453 --> 5774:35:11,050.66699981689453
The gibbon saw Monkey and rushed over.

53
5774:36:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5842:13:31,050.66699981689453
[g@"Your Majesty," said the gibbon.

54
5842:15:11,050.66699981689453 --> 5930:05:11,050.66699981689453
"You look sad. What's wrong?"@g]

55
5930:06:51,050.66699981689453 --> 6052:21:51,050.66699981689453
Monkey sighed. "Our life here is perfect."

56
6052:23:31,050.66699981689453 --> 6120:36:51,050.66699981689453
[g@"Yes, that's true," said the gibbon.

57
6120:38:31,050.66699981689453 --> 6181:21:51,050.66699981689453
"So why are you sad?"@g]

58
6181:23:31,050.66699981689453 --> 6255:21:51,050.66699981689453
[g@Monkey was quiet for a moment.

59
6255:23:31,050.66699981689453 --> 6343:11:51,050.66699981689453
Then he said, "Someday our lives will end.@g]

60
6343:13:31,050.66699981689453 --> 6422:58:31,050.66699981689453
I wish this perfect life could last forever."

61
6423:00:11,050.66699981689453 --> 6483:26:51,050.66699981689453
[g@The gibbon's eyes lit up.

62
6483:28:31,050.66699981689453 --> 6594:58:31,050.66699981689453
"Oh," he said. "You want to live forever?"@g]

63
6595:00:11,050.66699981689453 --> 6664:51:51,050.66699981689453
"I do," said Monkey.

64
6664:53:31,050.66699981689453 --> 6734:41:51,050.66699981689453
[g@The gibbon rubbed his chin.

65
6734:43:31,050.66699981689453 --> 6809:35:11,050.66699981689453
"Then you must study with a sage.@g]

66
6809:36:51,050.66699981689453 --> 6909:18:31,050.66699981689453
[g@Sages are very wise people.

67
6909:20:11,050.66699981689453 --> 6993:55:11,050.66699981689453
They can turn themselves into other animals.@g]

68
6993:56:51,050.66699981689453 --> 7069:56:51,050.66699981689453
[g@They can fly through the sky.

69
7069:58:31,050.66699981689453 --> 7171:41:51,050.66699981689453
And they know how to live forever."@g]

70
7171:43:31,050.66699981689453 --> 7241:40:11,050.66699981689453
[g@Monkey smiled again.

71
7241:41:51,050.66699981689453 --> 7328:31:51,050.66699981689453
"Where can I find a sage?" he asked.@g]

72
7328:33:31,050.66699981689453 --> 7427:43:31,050.66699981689453
"You must find a land with people," said the gibbon.

73
7427:45:11,050.66699981689453 --> 7531:51:51,050.66699981689453
"That's where you'll find a sage."

74
7531:53:31,050.66699981689453 --> 7699:03:31,050.66699981689453
The next morning Monkey built a raft and loaded food onto it.

75
7699:05:11,050.66699981689453 --> 7806:58:31,050.66699981689453
He pushed the raft into the stream and jumped on.

76
7807:00:11,050.66699981689453 --> 7950:13:31,050.66699981689453
As the raft began to float away, Monkey waved to his friends.

77
7950:15:11,050.66699981689453 --> 8013:16:51,050.66699981689453
"Don't worry!" he called.

78
8013:18:31,050.66699981689453 --> 8230:15:11,050.66699981689453
"After I learn how to live forever, I will return!"
