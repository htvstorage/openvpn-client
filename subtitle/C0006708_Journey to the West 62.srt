1
00:00:11,000 --> 154:48:31,000
Wukong landed on Mount Potalaka.

2
154:50:11,000 --> 241:18:31,000
A young man was meditating in the garden.

3
241:20:11,000 --> 311:46:51,000
"Where's Guanyin?" asked the monkey.

4
311:48:31,000 --> 398:01:51,000
[g@"She's making a basket," said the man.

5
398:03:31,000 --> 453:41:51,000
He glanced up at the monkey.@g]

6
453:43:31,000 --> 528:01:51,000
"It's good to see you again, Wukong."

7
528:03:31,000 --> 574:56:51,000
[g@Wukong was puzzled.

8
574:58:31,000 --> 637:53:31,000
"How do you know my name?"@g]

9
637:55:11,000 --> 768:25:11,000
"Don't you recognize me?" said the man.

10
768:26:51,000 --> 863:18:31,000
Wukong stared for a moment and then gasped.

11
863:20:11,000 --> 916:01:51,000
[g@"You're Red Boy!

12
916:03:31,000 --> 987:16:51,000
You look like a kind spirit now."@g]

13
987:18:31,000 --> 1051:06:51,000
[g@"Yes," said Red Boy.

14
1051:08:31,000 --> 1112:38:31,000
"I'm not an evil demon anymore.@g]

15
1112:40:11,000 --> 1182:08:31,000
[g@And I have you to thank for that.

16
1182:10:11,000 --> 1238:31:51,000
You brought Guanyin to me.@g]

17
1238:33:31,000 --> 1357:38:31,000
She has taught me all about Buddhism, and now I'm very happy."

18
1357:40:11,000 --> 1434:00:11,000
[g@"You're welcome," said Wukong.

19
1434:01:51,000 --> 1490:00:11,000
"You and I have a lot in common.@g]

20
1490:01:51,000 --> 1596:08:31,000
[g@We were both evil, causing all sorts of problems.

21
1596:10:11,000 --> 1678:05:11,000
Now we're both Buddhists."@g]

22
1678:06:51,000 --> 1761:41:51,000
[g@Guanyin came over holding a basket.

23
1761:43:31,000 --> 1847:51:51,000
"Hello, Wukong," said the bodhisattva.@g]

24
1847:53:31,000 --> 1915:41:51,000
"I knew you would come here today.

25
1915:43:31,000 --> 2030:31:51,000
I've been working on this basket all morning."

26
2030:33:31,000 --> 2134:20:11,000
A look of confusion spread across the monkey's face.

27
2134:21:51,000 --> 2231:51:51,000
[g@"That's a nice basket, Bodhisattva.

28
2231:53:31,000 --> 2314:21:51,000
But what is it for?"@g]

29
2314:23:31,000 --> 2422:20:11,000
"This basket has magical powers," said Guanyin.

30
2422:21:51,000 --> 2737:05:11,000
"I will catch the demon with it. Let's go."

31
2737:06:51,000 --> 2823:45:11,000
Wukong returned to the river with Guanyin.

32
2823:46:51,000 --> 2963:03:31,000
The bodhisattva used a rope to lower the basket into the river.

33
2963:05:11,000 --> 3062:50:11,000
She recited a spell and then waited.

34
3062:51:51,000 --> 3276:25:11,000
After a moment she pulled the basket out of the water.

35
3276:26:51,000 --> 3338:56:51,000
[g@Wukong looked in the basket.

36
3338:58:31,000 --> 3441:05:11,000
A small goldfish was flopping around in it.@g]

37
3441:06:51,000 --> 3509:41:51,000
The monkey laughed.

38
3509:43:31,000 --> 3595:40:11,000
[g@"I guess you need to try again, Bodhisattva.

39
3595:41:51,000 --> 3664:23:31,000
That's not the demon."@g]

40
3664:25:11,000 --> 3770:33:31,000
[g@"This is my goldfish," said Guanyin.

41
3770:35:11,000 --> 3860:46:51,000
"It usually lives in my lotus pond.@g]

42
3860:48:31,000 --> 3973:23:31,000
The pond is near my garden, where I teach my students.

43
3973:25:11,000 --> 4117:43:31,000
After years of listening to my lessons, the fish became a spirit.

44
4117:45:11,000 --> 4200:43:31,000
[g@It escaped to Earth a few days ago.

45
4200:45:11,000 --> 4284:13:31,000
I had been wondering where it was."@g]

46
4284:15:11,000 --> 4368:00:11,000
"A few days ago," repeated Wukong.

47
4368:01:51,000 --> 4477:13:31,000
"That means it's been on Earth for a few years."

48
4477:15:11,000 --> 4541:03:31,000
[g@"Correct," said Guanyin.

49
4541:05:11,000 --> 4605:16:51,000
"The Tang Monk is safe now.@g]

50
4605:18:31,000 --> 4756:11:51,000
You may go free him and continue your journey to the Western Paradise."

51
4756:13:31,000 --> 4935:43:31,000
Guanyin flew off, and Wukong swam down to the palace.

52
4935:45:11,000 --> 5042:55:11,000
Now that the goldfish was gone, so was its magic.

53
5042:56:51,000 --> 5175:33:31,000
The monkey smashed the rocks with his iron bar and went inside.

54
5175:35:11,000 --> 5311:31:51,000
"Master, I'm here!" he cried.

55
5311:33:31,000 --> 5452:13:31,000
He got the monk out of the box and carried him out of the river.

56
5452:15:11,000 --> 5597:28:31,000
By now all the villagers had heard that Wukong had saved Chen's son.

57
5597:30:11,000 --> 5902:11:51,000
When the travelers returned, the villagers cheered.

58
5902:13:31,000 --> 6009:46:51,000
"Please stay in our village!" said a man.

59
6009:48:31,000 --> 6087:55:11,000
"Yes," said an old woman.

60
6087:56:51,000 --> 6170:11:51,000
[g@"There's no rush to leave.

61
6170:13:31,000 --> 6267:01:51,000
Stay for as long as you like."@g]

62
6267:03:31,000 --> 6330:53:31,000
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

63
6330:55:11,000 --> 6409:18:31,000
"But we can stay only one more night, to rest.

64
6409:20:11,000 --> 6467:25:11,000
[g@In the morning we must leave.

65
6467:26:51,000 --> 6570:50:11,000
We still have far to travel."@g]

66
6570:51:51,000 --> 6690:48:31,000
The villagers held a feast for the travelers that evening.

67
6690:50:11,000 --> 6834:38:31,000
By the time everyone went to sleep, it was late.

68
6834:40:11,000 --> 6941:16:51,000
The next morning the travelers woke to the sound of chopping.

69
6941:18:31,000 --> 7042:51:51,000
"What's going on?" asked the Tang Monk.

70
7042:53:31,000 --> 7143:08:31,000
They went to the river and found a very busy scene.

71
7143:10:11,000 --> 7236:21:51,000
[g@Several men were chopping down trees.

72
7236:23:31,000 --> 7311:15:11,000
Other people carried tools.@g]

73
7311:16:51,000 --> 7428:25:11,000
"We're building a boat for you!" said a smiling man.

74
7428:26:51,000 --> 7497:06:51,000
"Thank you," said the monk.

75
7497:08:31,000 --> 7603:01:51,000
He and his companions sat down by the water to wait.

76
7603:03:31,000 --> 7740:15:11,000
Suddenly there was a rumble, and waves splashed onto the shore.

77
7740:16:51,000 --> 7995:58:31,000
Everyone stared in fear as a large creature rose from the waves.
