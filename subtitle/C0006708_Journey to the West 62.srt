1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,573
Wukong landed on Mount Potalaka.

2
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:19,687
A young man was meditating in the garden.

3
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:22,224
"Where's Guanyin?" asked the monkey.

4
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:25,329
"She's making a basket," said the man.

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,333
He glanced up at the monkey.

6
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:30,009
"It's good to see you again, Wukong."

7
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,698
Wukong was puzzled.

8
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,964
"How do you know my name?"

9
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:38,663
"Don't you recognize me?" said the man.

10
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:42,079
Wukong stared for a moment and then gasped.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,977
"You're Red Boy!

12
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,542
You look like a kind spirit now."

13
00:00:46,543 --> 00:00:48,840
"Yes," said Red Boy.

14
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,055
"I'm not an evil demon anymore.

15
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:53,557
And I have you to thank for that.

16
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:55,587
You brought Guanyin to me.

17
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,875
She has taught me all about Buddhism, and now I'm very happy."

18
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:02,624
"You're welcome," said Wukong.

19
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,640
"You and I have a lot in common.

20
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:08,461
We were both evil, causing all sorts of problems.

21
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:11,411
Now we're both Buddhists."

22
00:01:11,412 --> 00:01:14,421
Guanyin came over holding a basket.

23
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:17,523
"Hello, Wukong," said the bodhisattva.

24
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:19,965
"I knew you would come here today.

25
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:24,099
I've been working on this basket all morning."

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,836
A look of confusion spread across the monkey's face.

27
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,347
"That's a nice basket, Bodhisattva.

28
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:34,317
But what is it for?"

29
00:01:34,318 --> 00:01:38,204
"This basket has magical powers," said Guanyin.

30
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:49,535
"I will catch the demon with it. Let's go."

31
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:52,655
Wukong returned to the river with Guanyin.

32
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:57,670
The bodhisattva used a rope to lower the basket into the river.

33
00:01:57,671 --> 00:02:01,262
She recited a spell and then waited.

34
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:08,951
After a moment she pulled the basket out of the water.

35
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:11,202
Wukong looked in the basket.

36
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:14,879
A small goldfish was flopping around in it.

37
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,349
The monkey laughed.

38
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,444
"I guess you need to try again, Bodhisattva.

39
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:22,918
That's not the demon."

40
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,740
"This is my goldfish," said Guanyin.

41
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:29,988
"It usually lives in my lotus pond.

42
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:34,042
The pond is near my garden, where I teach my students.

43
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:39,238
After years of listening to my lessons, the fish became a spirit.

44
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,226
It escaped to Earth a few days ago.

45
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:45,232
I had been wondering where it was."

46
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:48,248
"A few days ago," repeated Wukong.

47
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:52,180
"That means it's been on Earth for a few years."

48
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:54,478
"Correct," said Guanyin.

49
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,790
"The Tang Monk is safe now.

50
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:02,223
You may go free him and continue your journey to the Western Paradise."

51
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:08,686
Guanyin flew off, and Wukong swam down to the palace.

52
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:12,545
Now that the goldfish was gone, so was its magic.

53
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:17,320
The monkey smashed the rocks with his iron bar and went inside.

54
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:22,215
"Master, I'm here!" he cried.

55
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:27,280
He got the monk out of the box and carried him out of the river.

56
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:32,509
By now all the villagers had heard that Wukong had saved Chen's son.

57
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:43,479
When the travelers returned, the villagers cheered.

58
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,352
"Please stay in our village!" said a man.

59
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:50,165
"Yes," said an old woman.

60
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,127
"There's no rush to leave.

61
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:56,613
Stay for as long as you like."

62
00:03:56,614 --> 00:03:58,912
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

63
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:01,735
"But we can stay only one more night, to rest.

64
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,827
In the morning we must leave.

65
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:07,550
We still have far to travel."

66
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:11,869
The villagers held a feast for the travelers that evening.

67
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,047
By the time everyone went to sleep, it was late.

68
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,886
The next morning the travelers woke to the sound of chopping.

69
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:24,543
"What's going on?" asked the Tang Monk.

70
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:28,153
They went to the river and found a very busy scene.

71
00:04:28,154 --> 00:04:31,509
Several men were chopping down trees.

72
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,205
Other people carried tools.

73
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:38,423
"We're building a boat for you!" said a smiling man.

74
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:40,896
"Thank you," said the monk.

75
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:44,709
He and his companions sat down by the water to wait.

76
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,649
Suddenly there was a rumble, and waves splashed onto the shore.

77
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:58,855
Everyone stared in fear as a large creature rose from the waves.
