00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 177:06:50,933.3329999446869
Wukong stared at the cave door, shocked.

177:08:30,933.3329999446869 --> 215:23:30,933.3329999446869

215:25:10,933.3329999446869 --> 336:28:30,933.3329999446869
One-Horned Buffalo stole our weapons again!"@g]

4
336:30:10,933.3329999446869 --> 467:15:10,933.3329999446869
"What will we do now?" asked the fire god.

5
467:16:50,933.3329999446869 --> 609:25:10,933.3330001831055
"This demon's powers are stronger than any I've seen before," said Wukong.

6
609:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 740:28:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"I know one person who can definitely defeat him—Buddha.

7
740:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 788:30:10,933.3330001831055
I'll be back soon."@g]

8
788:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 955:15:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey leaped onto a cloud and soared toward the West.

9
955:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1057:30:10,933.3330001831055
[g@He arrived at the Thunderclap Monastery.

10
1057:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1159:43:30,933.3330001831055
A guard at the gate stopped him.@g]

11
1159:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1257:01:50,933.3330001831055
"I need to ask Buddha for help," Wukong told the guard.

12
1257:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1344:26:50,933.3330001831055
"It's about the Tang Monk's journey."

13
1344:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1418:05:10,933.3330001831055
The guard waved the monkey through.

14
1418:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1543:53:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong entered the monastery and bowed before Buddha.

15
1543:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1660:10:10,933.3330001831055
"Greetings, Buddha," said the monkey. "I need—"

16
1660:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1713:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Buddha held up a hand.

17
1713:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1801:03:30,933.3330001831055
"I know why you're here, Wukong.@g]

18
1801:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1892:56:50,933.3330001831055
[g@I also know who the demon is.

19
1892:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1989:40:10,933.3330001831055
You must go to Laozi for help."@g]

20
1989:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2175:13:30,933.3330001831055
"Oh, okay," said the monkey, a bit surprised. "Thank you."

21
2175:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2260:00:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong flew toward Heaven.

22
2260:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2355:03:30,933.3330001831055
"Laozi doesn't like me much," thought the monkey.

23
2355:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2560:58:30,933.3330001831055
"He won't be happy to see me."

24
2561:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2680:11:50,933.3330001831055
When Wukong arrived at Laozi's house, the sage frowned.

25
2680:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2778:25:10,933.3330001831055
"What do you want, Wukong?" asked Laozi.

26
2778:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2860:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Buddha told me to come here," said Wukong.

27
2860:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2983:30:10,933.3330001831055
"The Tang Monk was captured by a demon called One-Horned Buffalo."

28
2983:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3069:01:50,933.3330001831055
"Oh dear!" said Laozi.

29
3069:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3140:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Do you know him?" asked the monkey.

30
3140:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3227:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Laozi nodded. "He's my green buffalo.

31
3227:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3313:05:10,933.3330001831055
I didn't realize he'd escaped."@g]

32
3313:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3424:15:10,933.3330001831055
"Well, he did," said Wukong, getting annoyed.

33
3424:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3526:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"And he's planning to eat the Tang Monk.

34
3526:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3603:08:30,933.3330001831055
Your buffalo also has a metal ring.@g]

35
3603:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3715:53:30,933.3330001831055
Every time we try to fight him, the ring sucks in our weapons!"

36
3715:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3771:38:30,933.3330001831055
Laozi held up his hands.

37
3771:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3966:36:50,933.3330001831055
"Okay, okay. I can capture the buffalo. Don't worry."

38
3966:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4084:05:10,933.3330001831055
The sage went into another room.

39
4084:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4336:40:10,933.3330001831055
When he came back, he was holding a fan. "Let's go."

40
4336:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4446:58:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong and Laozi returned to the mountain.

41
4447:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4585:50:10,933.3330001831055
"Buffalo!" shouted Laozi. "Get out here right now!"

42
4585:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4740:10:10,933.3330001831055
The door flew open, and One-Horned Buffalo stepped outside.

43
4740:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4837:13:30,933.3330001831055
His face fell when he saw Laozi.

44
4837:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4996:43:30,933.3330001831055
Laozi raised the fan and brought it down fast.

45
4996:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5144:56:50,933.3330001831055
A fierce wind nearly knocked over One-Horned Buffalo.

46
5144:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5311:56:50,933.3330001831055
The demon pulled off the metal ring and flung it at Laozi.

47
5311:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5450:21:50,933.3330001831055
The sage caught it and brought the fan down once more.

48
5450:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5612:48:30,933.3330001831055
The wind knocked over the demon, and he turned into a large, green buffalo.

49
5612:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5723:11:50,933.3330001831055
The buffalo stood up and snorted.

50
5723:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5851:35:10,933.3330001831055
Laozi tucked the fan and the ring into his robe.

51
5851:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6031:51:50,933.3330001831055
Then he climbed onto the buffalo and rode up into the sky.

52
6031:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6199:06:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong went into the cave, and the warrior and two gods followed.

53
6199:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6284:45:10,933.3330001831055
They soon found their weapons.

54
6284:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6398:05:10,933.3330001831055
"The gods and I will return to Heaven now," said the warrior.

55
6398:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6474:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Good luck with your journey, Wukong."

56
6474:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6588:03:30,933.3330001831055
"Thank you," said the monkey.

57
6588:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6712:43:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong found his companions deep in the cave.

58
6712:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6907:23:30,933.3330001831055
"What took you so long?" cried Bajie.

59
6907:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6980:08:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"I was busy fighting a demon,"

60
6980:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7067:30:10,933.3330001831055
said Wukong, untying the Tang Monk.@g]

61
7067:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7137:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Thank you, Wukong," said the monk.

62
7137:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7202:11:50,933.3330001831055
"You're welcome," said the monkey.

63
7202:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7364:13:30,933.3330001831055
"But next time I tell you to stay away from a place, please listen!"

64
7364:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7493:51:50,933.3330001831055
A few weeks later, the travelers arrived at a busy city.

65
7493:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7661:38:30,933.3330001831055
The streets were filled with people selling [n@vegetables, spices, and other goods.

66
7661:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7765:28:30,933.3330001831055
An old woman was stirring a large pot of soup.

67
7765:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7859:23:30,933.3330001831055
Other food sizzled over fires.

68
7859:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7970:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie breathed deep.

69
7970:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8102:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Ah! That smells wonderful!"@g]

70
8102:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8214:20:10,933.3330001831055
Suddenly a young woman rushed out of the crowd.

71
8214:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8284:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"The Tang Monk!" she cried.

72
8284:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8358:03:30,933.3330001831055
She threw her arms around the monk.@g]

73
8358:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8614:20:10,933.3330001831055
A fierce wind swirled, and a second later they were both gone!
