1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:17,309
Wukong stared at the cave door, shocked.

2
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,687
"I don't believe it.

3
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:23,046
One-Horned Buffalo stole our weapons again!"

4
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:27,754
"What will we do now?" asked the fire god.

5
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:32,872
"This demon's powers are stronger than any I've seen before," said Wukong.

6
00:00:32,873 --> 00:00:37,590
"I know one person who can definitely defeat him—Buddha.

7
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:39,319
I'll be back soon."

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,322
The monkey leaped onto a cloud and soared toward the West.

9
00:00:45,323 --> 00:00:49,003
He arrived at the Thunderclap Monastery.

10
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:52,683
A guard at the gate stopped him.

11
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:56,186
"I need to ask Buddha for help," Wukong told the guard.

12
00:00:56,187 --> 00:00:59,333
"It's about the Tang Monk's journey."

13
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:01,984
The guard waved the monkey through.

14
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:06,513
Wukong entered the monastery and bowed before Buddha.

15
00:01:06,514 --> 00:01:10,699
"Greetings, Buddha," said the monkey. "I need—"

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,623
Buddha held up a hand.

17
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:15,771
"I know why you're here, Wukong.

18
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:19,079
I also know who the demon is.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,561
You must go to Laozi for help."

20
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:29,241
"Oh, okay," said the monkey, a bit surprised. "Thank you."

21
00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:32,293
Wukong flew toward Heaven.

22
00:01:32,294 --> 00:01:35,715
"Laozi doesn't like me much," thought the monkey.

23
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:43,128
"He won't be happy to see me."

24
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:47,420
When Wukong arrived at Laozi's house, the sage frowned.

25
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:50,956
"What do you want, Wukong?" asked Laozi.

26
00:01:50,957 --> 00:01:53,903
"Buddha told me to come here," said Wukong.

27
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:58,339
"The Tang Monk was captured by a demon called One-Horned Buffalo."

28
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,418
"Oh dear!" said Laozi.

29
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:04,005
"Do you know him?" asked the monkey.

30
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:07,117
Laozi nodded. "He's my green buffalo.

31
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,204
I didn't realize he'd escaped."

32
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:14,206
"Well, he did," said Wukong, getting annoyed.

33
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:17,891
"And he's planning to eat the Tang Monk.

34
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:20,646
Your buffalo also has a metal ring.

35
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:24,705
Every time we try to fight him, the ring sucks in our weapons!"

36
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:26,712
Laozi held up his hands.

37
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:33,731
"Okay, okay. I can capture the buffalo. Don't worry."

38
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:37,960
The sage went into another room.

39
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:47,053
When he came back, he was holding a fan. "Let's go."

40
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:51,024
Wukong and Laozi returned to the mountain.

41
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:56,023
"Buffalo!" shouted Laozi. "Get out here right now!"

42
00:02:56,024 --> 00:03:01,579
The door flew open, and One-Horned Buffalo stepped outside.

43
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,073
His face fell when he saw Laozi.

44
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:10,815
Laozi raised the fan and brought it down fast.

45
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:16,151
A fierce wind nearly knocked over One-Horned Buffalo.

46
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:22,163
The demon pulled off the metal ring and flung it at Laozi.

47
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:27,146
The sage caught it and brought the fan down once more.

48
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:32,994
The wind knocked over the demon, and he turned into a large, green buffalo.

49
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:36,968
The buffalo stood up and snorted.

50
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:41,590
Laozi tucked the fan and the ring into his robe.

51
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:48,080
Then he climbed onto the buffalo and rode up into the sky.

52
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:54,101
Wukong went into the cave, and the warrior and two gods followed.

53
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:57,184
They soon found their weapons.

54
00:03:57,185 --> 00:04:01,264
"The gods and I will return to Heaven now," said the warrior.

55
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:04,011
"Good luck with your journey, Wukong."

56
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:08,103
"Thank you," said the monkey.

57
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:12,591
Wukong found his companions deep in the cave.

58
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:19,599
"What took you so long?" cried Bajie.

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,218
"I was busy fighting a demon,"

60
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:25,363
said Wukong, untying the Tang Monk.

61
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:27,879
"Thank you, Wukong," said the monk.

62
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,212
"You're welcome," said the monkey.

63
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:36,045
"But next time I tell you to stay away from a place, please listen!"

64
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:40,712
A few weeks later, the travelers arrived at a busy city.

65
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:46,752
The streets were filled with people selling vegetables, spices, and other goods.

66
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:50,490
An old woman was stirring a large pot of soup.

67
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,871
Other food sizzled over fires.

68
00:04:53,872 --> 00:04:57,859
Bajie breathed deep.

69
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,623
"Ah! That smells wonderful!"

70
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:06,649
Suddenly a young woman rushed out of the crowd.

71
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,163
"The Tang Monk!" she cried.

72
00:05:09,164 --> 00:05:11,823
She threw her arms around the monk.

73
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:21,049
A fierce wind swirled, and a second later they were both gone!
