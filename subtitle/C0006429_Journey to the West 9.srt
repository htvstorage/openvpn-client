1
00:00:11,134 --> 404:20:11,134
Wukong plucked a peach from a branch and bit into it.

2
404:21:51,134 --> 568:53:31,134
"This peach tastes wonderful!" he said.

3
568:55:11,134 --> 645:20:11,134
[g@He ate another peach.

4
645:21:51,134 --> 812:31:51,134
And then he ate another one.@g]

5
812:33:31,134 --> 1057:21:51,134
Each morning after that, Wukong secretly ate more and more peaches.

6
1057:23:31,134 --> 1173:50:11,134
After eating he climbed into a tree and took a nap.

7
1173:51:51,134 --> 1325:33:31,134
Time went by, and Wukong enjoyed his life in Heaven.

8
1325:35:11,134 --> 1424:06:51,134
Meanwhile the queen of Heaven was busy.

9
1424:08:31,134 --> 1605:16:51,134
It was almost time for the annual Peach Festival.

10
1605:18:31,134 --> 1764:05:11,134
She called for her maidens, Red Gown and Blue Gown.

11
1764:06:51,134 --> 1863:41:51,134
"How may we help you?" asked Red Gown.

12
1863:43:31,134 --> 1969:01:51,134
"The Peach Festival is tomorrow," said the queen.

13
1969:03:31,134 --> 2100:10:11,134
"All the important gods and spirits in Heaven will be here.

14
2100:11:51,134 --> 2252:31:51,134
I also invited the bodhisattva Guanyin, the goddess of mercy.

15
2252:33:31,134 --> 2490:28:31,134
Go to the Peach Garden now, and pick plenty of ripe peaches."

16
2490:30:11,134 --> 2599:23:31,134
Red Gown and Blue Gown went to the garden.

17
2599:25:11,134 --> 2911:00:11,134
As soon as they went through the gate, both maidens gasped.

18
2911:01:51,134 --> 3016:43:31,134
"Where are all the peaches?" cried Red Gown.

19
3016:45:11,134 --> 3141:43:31,134
"They're . . . gone!" cried Blue Gown.

20
3141:45:11,134 --> 3234:41:51,134
[g@"This is terrible!" said Red Gown.

21
3234:43:31,134 --> 3330:38:31,134
"The queen will be angry!"@g]

22
3330:40:11,134 --> 3422:51:51,134
Wukong had been sleeping up on a branch.

23
3422:53:31,134 --> 3545:15:11,134
When he heard the maidens, he woke up.

24
3545:16:51,134 --> 3608:33:31,134
[g@"Who's making all this noise?"

25
3608:35:11,134 --> 3729:46:51,134
he asked, jumping down to the ground.@g]

26
3729:48:31,134 --> 3811:58:31,134
"I'm trying to sleep!"

27
3812:00:11,134 --> 3864:45:11,134
[g@The maidens were startled.

28
3864:46:51,134 --> 3968:58:31,134
"We're sorry to wake you, sir," said Red Gown.@g]

29
3969:00:11,134 --> 4072:43:31,134
"We came to pick peaches for the Peach Festival.

30
4072:45:11,134 --> 4144:51:51,134
Do you know what happened toâ€”"

31
4144:53:31,134 --> 4229:51:51,134
[g@"The Peach Festival?" said Wukong.

32
4229:53:31,134 --> 4278:48:31,134
His eyes lit up.@g]

33
4278:50:11,134 --> 4329:46:51,134
"I didn't hear about that."

34
4329:48:31,134 --> 4443:48:31,134
"Oh, it's a wonderful festival," said Blue Gown.

35
4443:50:11,134 --> 4556:10:11,134
"All the important gods and spirits will be there."

36
4556:11:51,134 --> 4629:48:31,134
[g@"That sounds like fun," said Wukong.

37
4629:50:11,134 --> 4712:00:11,134
"I'm sure I'm invited, right?"@g]

38
4712:01:51,134 --> 4770:06:51,134
[g@Red Gown bit her lip.

39
4770:08:31,134 --> 4892:50:11,134
"Um, I don't think so."@g]

40
4892:51:51,134 --> 4955:00:11,134
[g@Wukong was furious.

41
4955:01:51,134 --> 5041:41:51,134
"The queen did not invite me?@g]

42
5041:43:31,134 --> 5163:08:31,134
I'm just as important as any other spirit or god!"

43
5163:10:11,134 --> 5226:15:11,134
The maidens looked nervous.

44
5226:16:51,134 --> 5388:01:51,134
"Sir," said Blue Gown. "Where are the peaches?"

45
5388:03:31,134 --> 5456:53:31,134
"I ate them," said Wukong.

46
5456:55:11,134 --> 5508:26:51,134
[g@"I ate every single one!

47
5508:28:31,134 --> 5579:25:11,134
And they were delicious!"@g]

48
5579:26:51,134 --> 5759:58:31,134
"Oh no!" cried Red Gown. "We must tell the queen."

49
5760:00:11,134 --> 5855:06:51,134
"No, you're not going to tell the queen," said Wukong.

50
5855:08:31,134 --> 5913:45:11,134
[g@He quickly said a spell.

51
5913:46:51,134 --> 6073:46:51,134
Instantly Red Gown and Blue Gown fell asleep.@g]

52
6073:48:31,134 --> 6210:48:31,134
Wukong looked at all the empty peach trees.

53
6210:50:11,134 --> 6255:03:31,134
[g@He shook his head.

54
6255:05:11,134 --> 6384:21:51,134
"I'm in big trouble."@g]

55
6384:23:31,134 --> 6564:46:51,134
When Red Gown and Blue Gown woke up, they ran back to the Cloud Palace.

56
6564:48:31,134 --> 6659:00:11,134
"Your Majesty!" cried Red Gown.

57
6659:01:51,134 --> 6738:33:31,134
[g@"Something terrible has happened!

58
6738:35:11,134 --> 6836:23:31,134
Sun Wukong ate all the peaches!"@g]

59
6836:25:11,134 --> 6985:33:31,134
"He got very angry and cast a spell on us," added Blue Gown.

60
6985:35:11,134 --> 7103:45:11,134
"When we woke up, he was gone."

61
7103:46:51,134 --> 7279:01:51,134
The queen's eyes flashed with anger.

62
7279:03:31,134 --> 7394:33:31,134
She went to the royal court and told the Jade Emperor.

63
7394:35:11,134 --> 7484:28:31,134
[g@"That horrible monkey!" cried the emperor.

64
7484:30:11,134 --> 7548:40:11,134
He turned to his captain.@g]

65
7548:41:51,134 --> 7620:05:11,134
[g@"Gather 100,000 soldiers.

66
7620:06:51,134 --> 7697:13:31,134
I want Wukong arrested!"@g]

67
7697:15:11,134 --> 7829:41:51,134
The captain nodded and then left the palace.

68
7829:43:31,134 --> 8057:33:31,134
Meanwhile the bodhisattva Guanyin left her [n@home on Mount Potalaka in the South Sea.

69
8057:35:11,134 --> 8178:08:31,134
She soon arrived at the Cloud Palace.

70
8178:10:11,134 --> 8284:15:11,134
"I'm sorry to tell you this," said the queen.

71
8284:16:51,134 --> 8392:03:31,134
"But there won't be a peach festival."

72
8392:05:11,134 --> 8495:51:51,134
"Why not?" asked Guanyin.

73
8495:53:31,134 --> 8636:58:31,134
"A monkey named Sun Wukong ate all the peaches," said the emperor.

74
8637:00:11,134 --> 8739:36:51,134
"I sent 100,000 soldiers to arrest him.

75
8739:38:31,134 --> 8832:35:11,134
They'll bring him back to Heaven soon."

76
8832:36:51,134 --> 8943:06:51,134
Just then a messenger ran into the court.

77
8943:08:31,134 --> 9015:06:51,134
"We need more soldiers, Your Majesty!"

78
9015:08:31,134 --> 9093:35:11,134
"What?" cried the emperor.

79
9093:36:51,134 --> 9207:01:51,134
"Wukong defeated the entire army," said the messenger.

80
9207:03:31,134 --> 9312:55:11,134
The Jade Emperor put his head in his hands.

81
9312:56:51,134 --> 9506:23:31,134
"We don't have any more soldiers!"
