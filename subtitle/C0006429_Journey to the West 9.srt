1
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:25,690
Wukong plucked a peach from a branch and bit into it.

2
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:31,614
"This peach tastes wonderful!" he said.

3
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:34,366
He ate another peach.

4
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:40,385
And then he ate another one.

5
00:00:40,386 --> 00:00:49,199
Each morning after that, Wukong secretly ate more and more peaches.

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,392
After eating he climbed into a tree and took a nap.

7
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:58,854
Time went by, and Wukong enjoyed his life in Heaven.

8
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:02,402
Meanwhile the queen of Heaven was busy.

9
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:08,924
It was almost time for the annual Peach Festival.

10
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:14,641
She called for her maidens, Red Gown and Blue Gown.

11
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:18,227
"How may we help you?" asked Red Gown.

12
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:22,019
"The Peach Festival is tomorrow," said the queen.

13
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,740
"All the important gods and spirits in Heaven will be here.

14
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:32,225
I also invited the bodhisattva Guanyin, the goddess of mercy.

15
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:40,791
Go to the Peach Garden now, and pick plenty of ripe peaches."

16
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:44,712
Red Gown and Blue Gown went to the garden.

17
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:55,930
As soon as they went through the gate, both maidens gasped.

18
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:59,736
"Where are all the peaches?" cried Red Gown.

19
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:04,236
"They're . . . gone!" cried Blue Gown.

20
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:07,583
"This is terrible!" said Red Gown.

21
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:11,037
"The queen will be angry!"

22
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,357
Wukong had been sleeping up on a branch.

23
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:18,763
When he heard the maidens, he woke up.

24
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,042
"Who's making all this noise?"

25
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:25,406
he asked, jumping down to the ground.

26
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:28,365
"I'm trying to sleep!"

27
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:30,265
The maidens were startled.

28
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:34,017
"We're sorry to wake you, sir," said Red Gown.

29
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:37,752
"We came to pick peaches for the Peach Festival.

30
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:40,349
Do you know what happened toâ€”"

31
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,409
"The Peach Festival?" said Wukong.

32
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,171
His eyes lit up.

33
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:47,006
"I didn't hear about that."

34
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:51,111
"Oh, it's a wonderful festival," said Blue Gown.

35
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:55,156
"All the important gods and spirits will be there."

36
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:57,807
"That sounds like fun," said Wukong.

37
00:02:57,808 --> 00:03:00,766
"I'm sure I'm invited, right?"

38
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,858
Red Gown bit her lip.

39
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:07,276
"Um, I don't think so."

40
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:09,514
Wukong was furious.

41
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:12,635
"The queen did not invite me?

42
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:17,007
I'm just as important as any other spirit or god!"

43
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:19,279
The maidens looked nervous.

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,103
"Sir," said Blue Gown. "Where are the peaches?"

45
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,582
"I ate them," said Wukong.

46
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,438
"I ate every single one!

47
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,993
And they were delicious!"

48
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:38,493
"Oh no!" cried Red Gown. "We must tell the queen."

49
00:03:38,494 --> 00:03:41,918
"No, you're not going to tell the queen," said Wukong.

50
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,029
He quickly said a spell.

51
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,790
Instantly Red Gown and Blue Gown fell asleep.

52
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:54,723
Wukong looked at all the empty peach trees.

53
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,316
He shook his head.

54
00:03:56,317 --> 00:04:00,971
"I'm in big trouble."

55
00:04:00,972 --> 00:04:07,466
When Red Gown and Blue Gown woke up, they ran back to the Cloud Palace.

56
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:10,858
"Your Majesty!" cried Red Gown.

57
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,722
"Something terrible has happened!

58
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:17,244
Sun Wukong ate all the peaches!"

59
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:22,614
"He got very angry and cast a spell on us," added Blue Gown.

60
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:26,869
"When we woke up, he was gone."

61
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:33,179
The queen's eyes flashed with anger.

62
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,338
She went to the royal court and told the Jade Emperor.

63
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:40,575
"That horrible monkey!" cried the emperor.

64
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,886
He turned to his captain.

65
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:45,457
"Gather 100,000 soldiers.

66
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,234
I want Wukong arrested!"

67
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:53,003
The captain nodded and then left the palace.

68
00:04:53,004 --> 00:05:01,206
Meanwhile the bodhisattva Guanyin left her home on Mount Potalaka in the South Sea.

69
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:05,547
She soon arrived at the Cloud Palace.

70
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:09,367
"I'm sorry to tell you this," said the queen.

71
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:13,248
"But there won't be a peach festival."

72
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:16,985
"Why not?" asked Guanyin.

73
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:22,065
"A monkey named Sun Wukong ate all the peaches," said the emperor.

74
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:25,760
"I sent 100,000 soldiers to arrest him.

75
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:29,107
They'll bring him back to Heaven soon."

76
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:33,086
Just then a messenger ran into the court.

77
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:35,678
"We need more soldiers, Your Majesty!"

78
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,503
"What?" cried the emperor.

79
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,587
"Wukong defeated the entire army," said the messenger.

80
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:46,399
The Jade Emperor put his head in his hands.

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,364
"We don't have any more soldiers!"
