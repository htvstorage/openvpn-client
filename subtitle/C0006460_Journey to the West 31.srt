00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:24,177
The two priests pushed the Tang Monk toward the enormous frying pan.

2
00:00:24,178 --> 00:00:26,727
"Stop!" cried Wukong.

3
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:29,006
[g@The priests stopped.

4
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:31,803
The Great Immortal looked around.@g]

5
00:00:31,804 --> 00:00:35,558
Wukong appeared and landed on the floor.

6
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,866
"You came back!" cried the Tang Monk.

7
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:42,381
"I was here the whole time," said the monkey.

8
00:00:42,382 --> 00:00:45,128
[g@He gave Bajie a nasty look.

9
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:48,112
"I didn't escape without you."@g]

10
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:51,331
Wukong turned to the Great Immortal.

11
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:54,437
"Please don't harm the Tang Monk," he said.

12
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:56,852
[g@"I will fix your ginseng tree.

13
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:59,205
But I need to get help."@g]

14
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:01,583
[g@"He's lying!" said Bajie.

15
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:04,927
"He doesn't know how to fix the tree!"@g]

16
00:01:04,928 --> 00:01:08,000
[g@"Be quiet, Bajie!" said Wukong.

17
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,037
"I'm not lying!"@g]

18
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:13,171
The Great Immortal thought for a moment.

19
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:19,803
"Okay, Wukong. I will give you until the [n@end of the day to fix my ginseng tree.

20
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:24,508
If you can't, the Tang Monk goes into the frying pan."

21
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,534
The monk shook with fear.

22
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:29,975
"Don't worry, Master," said the monkey.

23
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:31,413
[g@"I will find help.

24
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:33,729
I'll be back as soon as I can."@g]

25
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,704
Wukong shot out of the abbey and was gone.

26
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:41,833
Bajie shook his head. "We're doomed."

27
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:48,167
Wukong soared through the air until he came to Mount Potalaka.

28
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:52,135
Guanyin was meditating in her pagoda.

29
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:55,920
"Bodhisattva!" cried the monkey. "I need your help!

30
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:59,588
A Daoist named the Great Immortal is going to fry the Tang Monk.

31
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:03,222
I have until the end of the day to fix his ginseng tree."

32
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:07,187
"What happened to the tree?" asked Guanyin.

33
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:11,126
She gave the monkey a suspicious look.

34
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:16,002
"I, um, knocked it down," said Wukong.

35
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:21,291
"That was a terrible thing to do, Wukong," said Guanyin.

36
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:25,882
"The Great Immortal's ginseng tree is older than Heaven and Earth.

37
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:28,174
It was a rare treasure."

38
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:31,218
The monkey shrugged. "I was angry."

39
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:36,218
"You must learn to control your anger," said Guanyin.

40
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:38,461
[g@The bodhisattva stood up.

41
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:42,460
She went to a shelf and grabbed a vase.@g]

42
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:46,663
"This vase is filled with magic dew," she said.

43
00:02:46,664 --> 00:02:53,845
"It can bring spirit plants, such as the ginseng tree, back to life."

44
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:59,549
A short while later, Wukong and Guanyin arrived at the abbey.

45
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:06,718
Guanyin told Wukong, Bajie, and Wujing to stand the tree back up.

46
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:13,872
Guanyin rose into the air and poured the dew over the ginseng tree.

47
00:03:13,873 --> 00:03:19,810
As the dew droplets rolled over the branches, light sparkled.

48
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:24,919
The tree's color came back, and new leaves and fruit grew.

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,642
Soon the tree looked just as it had the day before.

50
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:34,373
To thank everyone, the Great Immortal decided to host a feast.

51
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:39,346
"I would like to share some ginseng fruit with everyone here," he said.

52
00:03:39,347 --> 00:03:43,400
Everyone went back into the abbey.

53
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:51,740
The two priests brought in trays of ginseng fruits.

54
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:58,067
"Mmm," said Bajie. "This fruit tastes wonderful if you eat it slowly."

55
00:03:58,068 --> 00:03:59,928
[g@He looked at Wukong.

56
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:02,601
"Sorry I didn't believe you earlier."@g]

57
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:05,318
[g@"Don't worry about it," said the monkey.

58
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,915
He took a bite of his fruit.@g]

59
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:12,005
The Tang Monk looked nervously at his fruit.

60
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:16,638
"It's safe to eat," Guanyin assured him.

61
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:19,785
[g@The monk took a bite and smiled.

62
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:22,249
He looked at the ginseng fruit again.@g]

63
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,811
"It doesn't look like a baby anymore," he said.

64
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:31,446
The next morning the travelers headed west along the road.

65
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:36,620
Weeks went by as they continued their journey.

66
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:42,495
They walked through rain and sunshine, heat and cold.

67
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:49,503
Up ahead, an evil spirit named Lady Whitebone sat by the side of the road.

68
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:53,853
She had been waiting by the road for years.

69
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:57,934
On this day she sniffed the air and smiled.

70
00:04:57,935 --> 00:05:02,229
"The Tang Monk is finally approaching.

71
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:11,590
I will eat him up, and I will live forever!"
