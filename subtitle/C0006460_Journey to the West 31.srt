00:00:11,266.66699999999946 --> 358:36:51,266.6670000553131
The two priests pushed the Tang Monk toward the enormous frying pan.

2
358:38:31,266.6670000553131 --> 429:26:51,266.6670000553131
"Stop!" cried Wukong.

3
429:28:31,266.6670000553131 --> 492:45:11,266.6670000553131
[g@The priests stopped.

4
492:46:51,266.6670000553131 --> 570:26:51,266.6670000553131
The Great Immortal looked around.@g]

5
570:28:31,266.6670000553131 --> 674:45:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong appeared and landed on the floor.

6
674:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 766:38:31,266.66699981689453
"You came back!" cried the Tang Monk.

7
766:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 864:16:51,266.66699981689453
"I was here the whole time," said the monkey.

8
864:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 940:35:11,266.66699981689453
[g@He gave Bajie a nasty look.

9
940:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1023:28:31,266.66699981689453
"I didn't escape without you."@g]

10
1023:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1112:53:31,266.66699981689453
Wukong turned to the Great Immortal.

11
1112:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1199:10:11,266.66699981689453
"Please don't harm the Tang Monk," he said.

12
1199:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1266:15:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"I will fix your ginseng tree.

13
1266:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1331:36:51,266.66699981689453
But I need to get help."@g]

14
1331:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1397:40:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"He's lying!" said Bajie.

15
1397:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1490:33:31,266.66699981689453
"He doesn't know how to fix the tree!"@g]

16
1490:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1575:55:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"Be quiet, Bajie!" said Wukong.

17
1575:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1632:30:11,266.66699981689453
"I'm not lying!"@g]

18
1632:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1719:33:31,266.66699981689453
The Great Immortal thought for a moment.

19
1719:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1903:46:51,266.66699981689453
"Okay, Wukong. I will give you until the [n@end of the day to fix my ginseng tree.

20
1903:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2034:28:31,266.66699981689453
If you can't, the Tang Monk goes into the frying pan."

21
2034:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2118:31:51,266.66699981689453
The monk shook with fear.

22
2118:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2186:20:11,266.66699981689453
"Don't worry, Master," said the monkey.

23
2186:21:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2226:16:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"I will find help.

24
2226:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2290:36:51,266.66699981689453
I'll be back as soon as I can."@g]

25
2290:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2401:01:51,266.66699981689453
Wukong shot out of the abbey and was gone.

26
2401:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2515:43:31,266.66699981689453
Bajie shook his head. "We're doomed."

27
2515:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2691:40:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong soared through the air until he came to Mount Potalaka.

28
2691:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2801:53:31,266.66699981689453
Guanyin was meditating in her pagoda.

29
2801:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2907:01:51,266.66699981689453
"Bodhisattva!" cried the monkey. "I need your help!

30
2907:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3008:55:11,266.66699981689453
A Daoist named the Great Immortal is going to fry the Tang Monk.

31
3008:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3109:51:51,266.66699981689453
I have until the end of the day to fix his ginseng tree."

32
3109:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3220:00:11,266.66699981689453
"What happened to the tree?" asked Guanyin.

33
3220:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3329:25:11,266.66699981689453
She gave the monkey a suspicious look.

34
3329:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3464:51:51,266.66699981689453
"I, um, knocked it down," said Wukong.

35
3464:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3611:46:51,266.66699981689453
"That was a terrible thing to do, Wukong," said Guanyin.

36
3611:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3739:18:31,266.66699981689453
"The Great Immortal's ginseng tree is older than Heaven and Earth.

37
3739:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3802:58:31,266.66699981689453
It was a rare treasure."

38
3803:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3887:31:51,266.66699981689453
The monkey shrugged. "I was angry."

39
3887:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4026:25:11,266.66699981689453
"You must learn to control your anger," said Guanyin.

40
4026:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4088:43:31,266.66699981689453
[g@The bodhisattva stood up.

41
4088:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4199:48:31,266.66699981689453
She went to a shelf and grabbed a vase.@g]

42
4199:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4316:33:31,266.66699981689453
"This vase is filled with magic dew," she said.

43
4316:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4516:03:31,266.66699981689453
"It can bring spirit plants, such as the ginseng tree, back to life."

44
4516:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4674:30:11,266.66699981689453
A short while later, Wukong and Guanyin arrived at the abbey.

45
4674:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4873:38:31,266.66699981689453
Guanyin told Wukong, Bajie, and Wujing to stand the tree back up.

46
4873:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5072:21:51,266.66699981689453
Guanyin rose into the air and poured the dew over the ginseng tree.

47
5072:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5237:18:31,266.66699981689453
As the dew droplets rolled over the branches, light sparkled.

48
5237:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5379:13:31,266.66699981689453
The tree's color came back, and new leaves and fruit grew.

49
5379:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5510:25:11,266.66699981689453
Soon the tree looked just as it had the day before.

50
5510:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5641:50:11,266.66699981689453
To thank everyone, the Great Immortal decided to host a feast.

51
5641:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5779:58:31,266.66699981689453
"I would like to share some ginseng fruit with everyone here," he said.

52
5780:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5892:35:11,266.66699981689453
Everyone went back into the abbey.

53
5892:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6124:15:11,266.66699981689453
The two priests brought in trays of ginseng fruits.

54
6124:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6300:00:11,266.66699981689453
"Mmm," said Bajie. "This fruit tastes wonderful if you eat it slowly."

55
6300:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6351:41:51,266.66699981689453
[g@He looked at Wukong.

56
6351:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6425:56:51,266.66699981689453
"Sorry I didn't believe you earlier."@g]

57
6425:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6501:25:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"Don't worry about it," said the monkey.

58
6501:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6573:33:31,266.66699981689453
He took a bite of his fruit.@g]

59
6573:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6687:10:11,266.66699981689453
The Tang Monk looked nervously at his fruit.

60
6687:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6815:51:51,266.66699981689453
"It's safe to eat," Guanyin assured him.

61
6816:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6903:16:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The monk took a bite and smiled.

62
6903:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6971:43:31,266.66699981689453
He looked at the ginseng fruit again.@g]

63
6971:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7070:40:11,266.66699981689453
"It doesn't look like a baby anymore," he said.

64
7070:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7227:11:51,266.66699981689453
The next morning the travelers headed west along the road.

65
7227:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7370:55:11,266.66699981689453
Weeks went by as they continued their journey.

66
7370:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7534:06:51,266.66699981689453
They walked through rain and sunshine, heat and cold.

67
7534:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7728:46:51,266.66699981689453
Up ahead, an evil spirit named Lady Whitebone sat by the side of the road.

68
7728:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7849:36:51,266.66699981689453
She had been waiting by the road for years.

69
7849:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7962:58:31,266.66699981689453
On this day she sniffed the air and smiled.

70
7963:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8082:16:51,266.66699981689453
"The Tang Monk is finally approaching.

71
8082:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8342:18:31,266.66699981689453
I will eat him up, and I will live forever!"
