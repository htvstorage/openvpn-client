1
00:00:11,000 --> 221:41:51,000
"I challenge you to a meditation contest," said the Tiger Immortal.

2
221:43:31,000 --> 335:11:51,000
"Whoever can meditate the longest without moving is the winner."

3
335:13:31,000 --> 383:36:51,000
[g@Wukong gulped.

4
383:38:31,000 --> 463:15:11,000
"I used to meditate a lot," he thought.@g]

5
463:16:51,000 --> 520:55:11,000
[g@"But I haven't done it lately.

6
520:56:51,000 --> 599:23:31,000
I'm terrible at sitting still."@g]

7
599:25:11,000 --> 668:15:11,000
[g@The Tang Monk stepped forward.

8
668:16:51,000 --> 732:31:51,000
"I accept your challenge."@g]

9
732:33:31,000 --> 807:50:11,000
"Master, are you sure?" asked Wujing.

10
807:51:51,000 --> 868:25:11,000
[g@The Tang Monk nodded.

11
868:26:51,000 --> 936:30:11,000
"I've spent many years meditating.@g]

12
936:31:51,000 --> 1008:33:31,000
This contest will be easy for me."

13
1008:35:11,000 --> 1070:33:31,000
[g@The Tiger Immortal grinned.

14
1070:35:11,000 --> 1163:03:31,000
"This won't be an ordinary meditation contest.@g]

15
1163:05:11,000 --> 1235:43:31,000
[g@We will float in the air and meditate.

16
1235:45:11,000 --> 1308:18:31,000
Can you do that?"@g]

17
1308:20:11,000 --> 1391:16:51,000
Now the Tang Monk looked nervous.

18
1391:18:31,000 --> 1517:48:31,000
But before the monk could answer, Wukong clapped him on the back.

19
1517:50:11,000 --> 1647:15:11,000
"Of course the Tang Monk can float in the air," the monkey replied.

20
1647:16:51,000 --> 1720:21:51,000
[g@Then he whispered into the monk's ear.

21
1720:23:31,000 --> 1769:18:31,000
"Don't worry, Master.@g]

22
1769:20:11,000 --> 1800:41:51,000
[g@You just meditate.

23
1800:43:31,000 --> 1872:33:31,000
I'll handle everything else."@g]

24
1872:35:11,000 --> 1970:21:51,000
"What are you babbling about?" snapped the Tiger Immortal.

25
1970:23:31,000 --> 2075:13:31,000
"Let's start the contest."

26
2075:15:11,000 --> 2196:38:31,000
The Tiger Immortal and the Tang Monk went in front of the crowd.

27
2196:40:11,000 --> 2313:01:51,000
They sat down with their legs crossed and their palms facing up.

28
2313:03:31,000 --> 2420:10:11,000
They closed their eyes and started meditating.

29
2420:11:51,000 --> 2571:20:11,000
After a moment the Tiger Immortal slowly floated up into the air.

30
2571:21:51,000 --> 2682:06:51,000
[g@"Uh-oh," said Bajie. "Master can't do that.

31
2682:08:31,000 --> 2734:08:31,000
He'll lose the contest."@g]

32
2734:10:11,000 --> 2800:00:11,000
[g@"Don't worry," said Wukong.

33
2800:01:51,000 --> 2878:08:31,000
"He just needs some help from me."@g]

34
2878:10:11,000 --> 3011:50:11,000
The monkey recited a spell and then blew toward the Tang Monk.

35
3011:51:51,000 --> 3095:46:51,000
[g@The monk lifted off the ground.

36
3095:48:31,000 --> 3165:36:51,000
His eyes remained closed.@g]

37
3165:38:31,000 --> 3312:38:31,000
Soon he was floating next to the Tiger Immortal.

38
3312:40:11,000 --> 3424:01:51,000
"I think Master will win this contest," said Wujing.

39
3424:03:31,000 --> 3525:31:51,000
"I'm pretty good at meditating too," said Bajie.

40
3525:33:31,000 --> 3602:10:11,000
"I could have competed in this contest."

41
3602:11:51,000 --> 3647:40:11,000
[g@Wukong smirked.

42
3647:41:51,000 --> 3747:30:11,000
"It would take a lot of magic to lift you, Bajie."@g]

43
3747:31:51,000 --> 3877:10:11,000
The pig snorted.

44
3877:11:51,000 --> 4017:16:51,000
"Master's face is twitching!" said Wujing suddenly.

45
4017:18:31,000 --> 4131:06:51,000
"Uh-oh," said Bajie. "I wonder what's wrong."

46
4131:08:31,000 --> 4214:26:51,000
[g@"Maybe he has a headache," said Wujing.

47
4214:28:31,000 --> 4250:05:11,000
"This isn't good.@g]

48
4250:06:51,000 --> 4353:21:51,000
If the monk moves at all, he will lose the contest."

49
4353:23:31,000 --> 4426:38:31,000
Wukong looked up at the Tang Monk.

50
4426:40:11,000 --> 4537:35:11,000
"I think he has an itch," said the monkey. "Wait here."

51
4537:36:51,000 --> 4663:40:11,000
Wukong became invisible and flew up to the monk.

52
4663:41:51,000 --> 4784:33:31,000
A flea was crawling on the monk's head.

53
4784:35:11,000 --> 4853:15:11,000
"Hmm," thought Wukong.

54
4853:16:51,000 --> 4933:40:11,000
[g@"Why would a flea be on the Tang Monk?

55
4933:41:51,000 --> 4992:35:11,000
He has no hair."@g]

56
4992:36:51,000 --> 5051:56:51,000
The monkey bit his lip.

57
5051:58:31,000 --> 5152:06:51,000
"The Tiger Immortal must have used magic to put this flea here.

58
5152:08:31,000 --> 5228:50:11,000
That rotten cheater!"

59
5228:51:51,000 --> 5355:38:31,000
Wukong brushed the flea away and scratched the Tang Monk's head.

60
5355:40:11,000 --> 5474:35:11,000
The monk's face stopped twitching.

61
5474:36:51,000 --> 5578:48:31,000
"Now I'll teach the Tiger Immortal a lesson," thought Wukong.

62
5578:50:11,000 --> 5738:35:11,000
The monkey plucked one of his hairs and turned it into a centipede.

63
5738:36:51,000 --> 5863:23:31,000
He dropped the centipede onto the Tiger Immortal's head.

64
5863:25:11,000 --> 6000:00:11,000
The Tiger Immortal's ear twitched as the centipede crawled over it.

65
6000:01:51,000 --> 6096:33:31,000
Then the centipede crawled along his mouth.

66
6096:35:11,000 --> 6184:46:51,000
[g@The Tiger Immortal's lip curled slightly.

67
6184:48:31,000 --> 6239:53:31,000
His nose wrinkled.@g]

68
6239:55:11,000 --> 6367:05:11,000
Next the centipede crawled on the Tiger Immortal's nose.

69
6367:06:51,000 --> 6475:11:51,000
The Tiger Immortal sniffed. And then . . .

70
6475:13:31,000 --> 6635:31:51,000
"Ouch!" cried the Tiger Immortal. "Something bit me!"

71
6635:33:31,000 --> 6792:35:11,000
He lost his concentration and fell, hitting the ground with a puff of smoke.

72
6792:36:51,000 --> 6929:41:51,000
[g@When the smoke cleared, a dead tiger lay on the ground.

73
6929:43:31,000 --> 6989:50:11,000
The crowd gasped.@g]

74
6989:51:51,000 --> 7122:10:11,000
Wukong and the Tang Monk came back down.

75
7122:11:51,000 --> 7176:33:31,000
[g@The crowd was silent.

76
7176:35:11,000 --> 7287:35:11,000
Daoists and Buddhists all stared at one another.@g]

77
7287:36:51,000 --> 7351:26:51,000
The monkey cleared his throat.

78
7351:28:31,000 --> 7458:20:11,000
"The Tiger Immortal was just an evil tiger spirit.

79
7458:21:51,000 --> 7640:13:31,000
Now that he's gone, I want you Daoists to treat the Buddhists kindly.

80
7640:15:11,000 --> 7849:45:11,000
Everybody should live together peacefully."
