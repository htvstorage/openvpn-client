1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,981
"I challenge you to a meditation contest," said the Tiger Immortal.

2
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:23,067
"Whoever can meditate the longest without moving is the winner."

3
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:24,810
Wukong gulped.

4
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:27,677
"I used to meditate a lot," he thought.

5
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:29,753
"But I haven't done it lately.

6
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:32,578
I'm terrible at sitting still."

7
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,057
The Tang Monk stepped forward.

8
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:37,371
"I accept your challenge."

9
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:40,082
"Master, are you sure?" asked Wujing.

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,263
The Tang Monk nodded.

11
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:44,714
"I've spent many years meditating.

12
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:47,308
This contest will be easy for me."

13
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,540
The Tiger Immortal grinned.

14
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,870
"This won't be an ordinary meditation contest.

15
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:55,486
We will float in the air and meditate.

16
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:58,099
Can you do that?"

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,086
Now the Tang Monk looked nervous.

18
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:05,641
But before the monk could answer, Wukong clapped him on the back.

19
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:10,301
"Of course the Tang Monk can float in the air," the monkey replied.

20
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:12,933
Then he whispered into the monk's ear.

21
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:14,695
"Don't worry, Master.

22
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:15,825
You just meditate.

23
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,412
I'll handle everything else."

24
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:21,933
"What are you babbling about?" snapped the Tiger Immortal.

25
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:25,708
"Let's start the contest."

26
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:30,079
The Tiger Immortal and the Tang Monk went in front of the crowd.

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,269
They sat down with their legs crossed and their palms facing up.

28
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,126
They closed their eyes and started meditating.

29
00:01:38,127 --> 00:01:43,568
After a moment the Tiger Immortal slowly floated up into the air.

30
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:47,556
"Uh-oh," said Bajie. "Master can't do that.

31
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:49,429
He'll lose the contest."

32
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,800
"Don't worry," said Wukong.

33
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:54,613
"He just needs some help from me."

34
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:59,426
The monkey recited a spell and then blew toward the Tang Monk.

35
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:02,448
The monk lifted off the ground.

36
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:04,962
His eyes remained closed.

37
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:10,255
Soon he was floating next to the Tiger Immortal.

38
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:14,265
"I think Master will win this contest," said Wujing.

39
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:17,919
"I'm pretty good at meditating too," said Bajie.

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,678
"I could have competed in this contest."

41
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:22,316
Wukong smirked.

42
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:25,910
"It would take a lot of magic to lift you, Bajie."

43
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:30,578
The pig snorted.

44
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:35,622
"Master's face is twitching!" said Wujing suddenly.

45
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:39,720
"Uh-oh," said Bajie. "I wonder what's wrong."

46
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:42,720
"Maybe he has a headache," said Wujing.

47
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:44,003
"This isn't good.

48
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:47,721
If the monk moves at all, he will lose the contest."

49
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:50,359
Wukong looked up at the Tang Monk.

50
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,353
"I think he has an itch," said the monkey. "Wait here."

51
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:58,892
Wukong became invisible and flew up to the monk.

52
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:03,244
A flea was crawling on the monk's head.

53
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:05,717
"Hmm," thought Wukong.

54
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,612
"Why would a flea be on the Tang Monk?

55
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:10,733
He has no hair."

56
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:12,870
The monkey bit his lip.

57
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:16,476
"The Tiger Immortal must have used magic to put this flea here.

58
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:19,238
That rotten cheater!"

59
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,803
Wukong brushed the flea away and scratched the Tang Monk's head.

60
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:28,085
The monk's face stopped twitching.

61
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:31,837
"Now I'll teach the Tiger Immortal a lesson," thought Wukong.

62
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:37,589
The monkey plucked one of his hairs and turned it into a centipede.

63
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,082
He dropped the centipede onto the Tiger Immortal's head.

64
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:47,000
The Tiger Immortal's ear twitched as the centipede crawled over it.

65
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:50,476
Then the centipede crawled along his mouth.

66
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:53,652
The Tiger Immortal's lip curled slightly.

67
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:55,636
His nose wrinkled.

68
00:03:55,637 --> 00:04:00,215
Next the centipede crawled on the Tiger Immortal's nose.

69
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:04,107
The Tiger Immortal sniffed. And then . . .

70
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:09,879
"Ouch!" cried the Tiger Immortal. "Something bit me!"

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,533
He lost his concentration and fell, hitting the ground with a puff of smoke.

72
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:20,469
When the smoke cleared, a dead tiger lay on the ground.

73
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,634
The crowd gasped.

74
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:27,398
Wukong and the Tang Monk came back down.

75
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,356
The crowd was silent.

76
00:04:29,357 --> 00:04:33,353
Daoists and Buddhists all stared at one another.

77
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:35,652
The monkey cleared his throat.

78
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:39,500
"The Tiger Immortal was just an evil tiger spirit.

79
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:46,048
Now that he's gone, I want you Daoists to treat the Buddhists kindly.

80
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:53,591
Everybody should live together peacefully."
