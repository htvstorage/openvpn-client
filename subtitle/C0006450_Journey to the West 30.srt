1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:18,168
Wukong and his companions were tied up in a room in the abbey.

2
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:22,537
"I will deal with you all in the morning," said the Great Immortal.

3
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:29,290
He turned around and left the room.

4
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,568
The Tang Monk began to cry.

5
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:37,932
"It's bad enough that there are dangers along the journey," he said.

6
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:42,157
"But my own companions are causing trouble for me!"

7
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:45,592
"Calm down, Master," said Wukong.

8
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:49,106
"We'll get out of this."

9
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:53,279
"Master, this is all Wukong's fault," said Bajie.

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,185
"He stole the ginseng fruit, and he knocked down the tree."

11
00:00:57,186 --> 00:01:01,351
"Stealing the fruit was your idea!" shouted the monkey.

12
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:05,230
"I can't help it if I was hungry," said Bajie.

13
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,379
"You should have refused to steal it."

14
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,701
"Let's stop arguing and figure out how to escape," said Wujing.

15
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:16,525
"I have a plan," said Wukong.

16
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:22,869
"But we must wait until the Great Immortal is asleep."

17
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,963
Late that night Wukong recited a spell.

18
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:31,795
He shrank to the size of a pea and then slipped out from his ropes.

19
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:35,641
He quickly untied his friends.

20
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:38,817
"Let's go," he whispered.

21
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:42,974
The group tiptoed through the dark and silent abbey.

22
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:49,148
When they got outside, the sun was beginning to rise.

23
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:54,151
"That was easy," said Bajie as they walked down the road.

24
00:01:54,152 --> 00:01:58,409
"I hope you all learned a lesson from this," said the Tang Monk.

25
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,044
Suddenly a voice boomed.

26
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:04,310
"You can't escape from me!"

27
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:07,401
The Great Immortal flew toward them.

28
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:11,338
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and swung.

29
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,580
The Great Immortal moved out of the way.

30
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:19,523
Bajie struck with his rake, and Wujing stabbed with his spear.

31
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:23,408
But the Great Immortal was fast.

32
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:27,558
He waved his arm, and his sleeve shot toward the group.

33
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:33,269
Once again the travelers were swept up.

34
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,266
Back at the abbey, the Great Immortal told his priests to start a fire.

35
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:44,001
"Bring out a large frying pan," said the Great Immortal.

36
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:47,100
"We're going to fry these criminals.

37
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:51,451
Let's start with Sun Wukong."

38
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:56,171
The priests carried an enormous frying pan into the room.

39
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:58,962
They placed it over the fire.

40
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:01,355
"Uh-oh," thought Wukong.

41
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:05,511
"I can sit on that frying pan all day and not get hurt at all.

42
00:03:05,512 --> 00:03:07,870
But the Tang Monk is mortal.

43
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:12,026
He'll be burned to a crisp!"

44
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:15,864
He spotted a statue of a lion nearby.

45
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:21,523
The monkey recited a quick spell and made the statue look exactly like himself.

46
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:24,686
Then he disappeared.

47
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:29,914
"Throw Sun Wukong into the frying pan!" said the Great Immortal.

48
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:37,054
Thinking the statue was Wukong, the two priests tried to lift it.

49
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:42,672
"This monkey is much heavier than he looks," said one priest, breathing heavily.

50
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:47,356
"Yes," said the other priest, panting.

51
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:53,230
They finally dragged the statue to the frying pan and dropped it in.

52
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:57,188
Crack! The frying pan broke in half.

53
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:00,953
"The monkey tricked us!" shouted the Great Immortal.

54
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:04,256
"He made that statue look like himself!"

55
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:07,818
"That rotten monkey!" cried Bajie.

56
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,826
"He escaped without us!"

57
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:14,525
"Do you really think he left us?" asked the Tang Monk.

58
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:17,392
"Look around!" said Bajie.

59
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:22,236
"He's gone! He probably returned to the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

60
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:25,555
I'm sure he's playing in a field of flowers right now.

61
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,427
Meanwhile we're trapped here!"

62
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:34,115
"I don't think he would leave us," said Wujing.

63
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:36,589
The Tang Monk started to cry.

64
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,558
The Great Immortal shook with anger.

65
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:42,834
"It's bad enough that Sun Wukong wanted to escape.

66
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:46,686
But did he really have to break my frying pan too?"

67
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,925
He stamped his foot.

68
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:51,649
"Bring out another frying pan.

69
00:04:51,650 --> 00:05:00,642
We'll fry his companions, starting with the Tang Monk!"
