00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 200:58:30,933.3329999446869
Wukong and his companions were tied up in a room in the abbey.

2
201:00:10,933.3329999446869 --> 322:20:10,933.3329999446869
"I will deal with you all in the morning," said the Great Immortal.

3
322:21:50,933.3329999446869 --> 509:55:10,933.3329999446869
He turned around and left the room.

4
509:56:50,933.3329999446869 --> 600:58:30,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk began to cry.

5
601:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 749:58:30,933.3330001831055
"It's bad enough that there are dangers along the journey," he said.

6
750:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 867:20:10,933.3330001831055
"But my own companions are causing trouble for me!"

7
867:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 962:45:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Calm down, Master," said Wukong.

8
962:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1060:21:50,933.3330001831055
"We'll get out of this."@g]

9
1060:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1176:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Master, this is all Wukong's fault," said Bajie.

10
1176:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1284:46:50,933.3330001831055
"He stole the ginseng fruit, and he knocked down the tree."

11
1284:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1400:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Stealing the fruit was your idea!" shouted the monkey.

12
1400:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1508:15:10,933.3330001831055
"I can't help it if I was hungry," said Bajie.

13
1508:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1595:43:30,933.3330001831055
"You should have refused to steal it."

14
1595:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1743:33:30,933.3330001831055
"Let's stop arguing and figure out how to escape," said Wujing.

15
1743:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1822:00:10,933.3330001831055
"I have a plan," said Wukong.

16
1822:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1998:13:30,933.3330001831055
"But we must wait until the Great Immortal is asleep."

17
1998:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2111:56:50,933.3330001831055
Late that night Wukong recited a spell.

18
2111:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2246:10:10,933.3330001831055
He shrank to the size of a pea and then slipped out from his ropes.

19
2246:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2353:00:10,933.3330001831055
He quickly untied his friends.

20
2353:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2441:13:30,933.3330001831055
"Let's go," he whispered.

21
2441:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2556:41:50,933.3330001831055
The group tiptoed through the dark and silent abbey.

22
2556:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2728:11:50,933.3330001831055
When they got outside, the sun was beginning to rise.

23
2728:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2867:10:10,933.3330001831055
"That was easy," said Bajie as they walked down the road.

24
2867:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2985:26:50,933.3330001831055
"I hope you all learned a lesson from this," said the Tang Monk.

25
2985:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3058:38:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Suddenly a voice boomed.

26
3058:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3149:21:50,933.3330001831055
"You can't escape from me!"@g]

27
3149:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3235:13:30,933.3330001831055
The Great Immortal flew toward them.

28
3235:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3344:35:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and swung.

29
3344:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3434:38:30,933.3330001831055
The Great Immortal moved out of the way.

30
3434:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3571:56:50,933.3330001831055
Bajie struck with his rake, and Wujing stabbed with his spear.

31
3571:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3679:51:50,933.3330001831055
But the Great Immortal was fast.

32
3679:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3795:08:30,933.3330001831055
He waved his arm, and his sleeve shot toward the group.

33
3795:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3953:46:50,933.3330001831055
Once again the travelers were swept up.

34
3953:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4120:21:50,933.3330001831055
Back at the abbey, the Great Immortal told his priests to start a fire.

35
4120:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4251:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Bring out a large frying pan," said the Great Immortal.

36
4251:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4337:58:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"We're going to fry these criminals.

37
4338:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4458:50:10,933.3330001831055
Let's start with Sun Wukong."@g]

38
4458:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4589:56:50,933.3330001831055
The priests carried an enormous frying pan into the room.

39
4589:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4667:28:30,933.3330001831055
They placed it over the fire.

40
4667:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4733:56:50,933.3330001831055
"Uh-oh," thought Wukong.

41
4733:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4849:23:30,933.3330001831055
"I can sit on that frying pan all day and not get hurt at all.

42
4849:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4914:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@But the Tang Monk is mortal.

43
4914:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5030:21:50,933.3330001831055
He'll be burned to a crisp!"@g]

44
5030:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5136:58:30,933.3330001831055
He spotted a statue of a lion nearby.

45
5137:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5294:10:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey recited a quick spell and made [n@the statue look exactly like himself.

46
5294:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5382:01:50,933.3330001831055
Then he disappeared.

47
5382:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5527:15:10,933.3330001831055
"Throw Sun Wukong into the frying pan!" said the Great Immortal.

48
5527:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5725:35:10,933.3330001831055
Thinking the statue was Wukong, the two priests tried to lift it.

49
5725:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5881:38:30,933.3330001831055
"This monkey is much heavier than he looks," [n@said one priest, breathing heavily.

50
5881:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6011:45:10,933.3330001831055
"Yes," said the other priest, panting.

51
6011:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6174:55:10,933.3330001831055
They finally dragged the statue to the frying pan and dropped it in.

52
6174:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6284:51:50,933.3330001831055
[i@Crack!@i] The frying pan broke in half.

53
6284:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6389:26:50,933.3330001831055
"The monkey tricked us!" shouted the Great Immortal.

54
6389:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6481:11:50,933.3330001831055
"He made that statue look like himself!"

55
6481:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6580:08:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"That rotten monkey!" cried Bajie.

56
6580:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6663:41:50,933.3330001831055
"He escaped without us!"@g]

57
6663:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6766:26:50,933.3330001831055
"Do you really think he left us?" asked the Tang Monk.

58
6766:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6846:05:10,933.3330001831055
"Look around!" said Bajie.

59
6846:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6980:38:30,933.3330001831055
"He's gone! He probably returned to the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

60
6980:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7072:50:10,933.3330001831055
I'm sure he's playing in a field of flowers right now.

61
7072:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7152:36:50,933.3330001831055
Meanwhile we're trapped here!"

62
7152:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7310:36:50,933.3330001831055
"I don't think he would leave us," said Wujing.

63
7310:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7379:20:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk started to cry.

64
7379:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7461:48:30,933.3330001831055
The Great Immortal shook with anger.

65
7461:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7552:48:30,933.3330001831055
"It's bad enough that Sun Wukong wanted to escape.

66
7552:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7659:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@But did he really have to break my frying pan too?"

67
7659:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7722:00:10,933.3330001831055
He stamped his foot.@g]

68
7722:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7797:40:10,933.3330001831055
"Bring out another frying pan.

69
7797:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8047:28:30,933.3330001831055
We'll fry his companions, starting with the Tang Monk!"
