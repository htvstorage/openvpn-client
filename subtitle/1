C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:[g@One day the rock split open.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:Inside was a monkey.@g]
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:He looked out the southern gate of Heaven [n@and saw the monkey on Earth below.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:[g@The light was gone.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:But the captain had magical sight.@g]
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:[g@There had been a rock on the mountain.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:The monkey came from the rock.@g]
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:[g@"It is so hot today!" cried one monkey.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:"Let's play in the stream."@g]
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:[g@The monkeys jumped into the cool water.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:Everyone splashed and played.@g]
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:[g@"We all love this stream," she said.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:"We drink from it.@g]
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:[g@We swim in it.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:We know that it flows all the way to the ocean.@g]
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:Higher and higher they went up the mountain [n@until they reached an enormous waterfall.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:[g@Mist filled the air.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:The water crashed down, roaring like thunder.@g]
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:[g@"Me too," said a second monkey.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:"But nobody could jump through it."@g]
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:"Whoever can jump through and come back [n@alive will be our king," said a gibbon.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:[g@All the monkeys and apes looked at one another.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:They shook their heads.@g]
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:[g@"Are you sure?" asked the gibbon.
C0006421_Journey to the West 1.srt:"It looks dangerous."@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@"No," said another monkey.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:"He probably got washed away down the river."@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:Suddenly—[i@splash!@i] Monkey shot out of the waterfall [n@and landed in front of the group.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@"Let's go," said the gibbon.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:He leaped through the waterfall.@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@After that, another monkey jumped through.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:Then some more jumped.@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@"That means I am now your king.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:Why aren't you bowing to me?"@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@Everyone else bowed too.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:"All hail the Monkey King!" they shouted.@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@Monkey sat on his throne and smiled.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:But then his smile faded.@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@"Your Majesty," said the gibbon.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:"You look sad. What's wrong?"@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@"Yes, that's true," said the gibbon.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:"So why are you sad?"@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@Monkey was quiet for a moment.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:Then he said, "Someday our lives will end.@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@The gibbon's eyes lit up.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:"Oh," he said. "You want to live forever?"@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@The gibbon rubbed his chin.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:"Then you must study with a sage.@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@Sages are very wise people.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:They can turn themselves into other animals.@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@They can fly through the sky.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:And they know how to live forever."@g]
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:[g@Monkey smiled again.
C0006422_Journey to the West 2.srt:"Where can I find a sage?" he asked.@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@"You're . . . a monkey!" he said.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:"And you're talking!"@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@"And I want to live forever.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:Do you know where I can find a sage?"@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@The woodcutter scratched his head.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:"Well, yes," he said.@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@"A sage named Subodhi lives on this mountain.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:He is very wise."@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@Monkey was excited.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:"Where can I find him?"@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:"Just follow this trail, and you will come [n@to his home," said the woodcutter.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@"A new student is about to arrive.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:Let him in."@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@The student looked confused.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:"Okay, Master," he said.@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@The student got up and went to the door of the temple.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:He looked outside.@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@"But you're just a monkey," said Subodhi.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:"How can you be my student?"@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@I traveled almost 13 years to get here.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:I'm sure I can be your student."@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@Subodhi stared at Monkey for a moment.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:"Who are your parents?" he asked.@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@"I don't have parents," he said.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:"I was born from a rock."@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@"You were probably created by Heaven and Earth.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:You may be my student.@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@You need a name."
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:He thought for a moment.@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:The monkey spent his days meditating, listening to [n@his teacher's lessons, and doing chores.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@Subodhi stood up.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:"How dare you dance while I'm teaching?" he shouted.@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@"I'm sorry," said Wukong.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:"But I was so happy, I needed to dance!"@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@Wukong shrugged. "I don't know.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:You tell me what I should learn."@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:[g@"Then forget it," said Wukong.
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:"Teach me something else."@g]
C0006423_Journey to the West 3.srt:None of the other students knew it, but Subodhi [n@had given him a secret message.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:The sage whispered prayers as well as secret [n@formulas about the universe and nature.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:As the monkey listened to his teacher's [n@words, powerful light filled the room.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:[g@Everyone looked very interested.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:They leaned in closer to Wukong.@g]
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:[g@He doesn't tell everyone those formulas.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:What did he teach you?"@g]
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:[g@Wukong stood up.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:He muttered a quick spell and made a sign with his hands.@g]
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:Suddenly—[i@zap!@i] The monkey was gone.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:[g@Wukong's voice came from the tree.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:"What do you think?"@g]
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:[g@The noise disturbed Subodhi.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:He ran outside and saw the enormous pine tree.@g]
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:[g@Everyone stopped cheering.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:Wukong quickly turned back into himself.@g]
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:[g@Subodhi kept talking.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:"Now all of the students have seen what you can do.@g]
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:[g@It's not safe for you to stay here anymore.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:You must go."@g]
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:[g@Wukong started to cry.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:"But, Master! Where will I go?"@g]
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:[g@The gibbon ran to him.
C0006424_Journey to the West 4.srt:"Your Majesty! Something terrible has happened!"@g]
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[g@Wukong was furious.
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:"Who is he? Where does he live?"@g]
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[g@"I am now as powerful as a god!
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:I'm not afraid of any demon.@g]
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[g@Wukong soon spotted a gloomy mountain.
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:Dark clouds hung over it.@g]
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[g@"The Demon of Chaos attacked my subjects!
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:I want revenge!"@g]
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[g@You attacked his subjects.
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:Now he wants revenge!"@g]
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[g@"He left to find a sage.
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:I guess he returned."@g]
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[g@The demon stood up.
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:"Does the monkey have any weapons?"@g]
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[g@He looked at Wukong and laughed.
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:"You're just a little monkey!" he said.@g]
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[g@"I'm not afraid of you!" said the demon.
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:He swung his sword.@g]
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[i@Pow!@i] Wukong hit the demon on the nose.
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[i@Poof!@i] Each strand of hair turned into a fake monkey—exactly like Wukong.
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[g@"What . . . What's going on?"
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:cried the demon, [n@trying to fight all the fake monkeys.@g]
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[g@"It's a magic spell," said Wukong.
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:"It's called Body Beyond the Body."@g]
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:[g@"Your Majesty!" cried the monkeys and apes.
C0006425_Journey to the West 5.srt:"You came back!"@g]
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[g@"But I am very powerful.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:I need a much heavier weapon."@g]
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[g@"That's a good idea," said Wukong.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:"I'll be back soon!"@g]
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[g@"It's nice to meet you," said the queen.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:"Would you like some tea?"@g]
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[g@"I need a heavy weapon because I'm as strong as a god.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:I want one of yours."@g]
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[i@Swish!@i] [i@Swoosh!@i] He waved the sword through the air, pretending to fight.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[g@"This sword is too light," said Wukong.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:"Find me a better weapon!"@g]
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:A few minutes later, several turtles and octopuses [n@dragged an enormous spear into the room.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[g@He shook his head.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:"This spear is too light."@g]
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[g@"That spear is very heavy!
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:How can you say it's too light?"@g]
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[g@"To me, it's light," said Wukong.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:"Find me something else!"@g]
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[g@Wukong stomped his foot.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:"I'm not leaving until I get what I want!"@g]
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[g@"Who cares?" said the queen.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:"I just want this monkey out of my palace!"@g]
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[g@"We can't," said the Dragon King.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:"It's too heavy for anyone to lift.@g]
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:"That pillar was used to measure all the oceans [n@and rivers," said the Dragon King.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:[g@The Dragon King folded his arms.
C0006426_Journey to the West 6.srt:"If you can pick it up, you can have it."@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@Sun Wukong put his hand on the iron pillar.
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:He felt it move.@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@The pillar shrank!
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:Soon it was just a little taller than Wukong.@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@Soon it was no bigger than a pin.
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:He placed it inside his ear.@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@Wukong went to bed happy.
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:But as he fell asleep, two spirits grabbed him.@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@"What are you doing?" asked Wukong.
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:"Let go of me!"@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@"That's where people go when they die.
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:I'm supposed to live forever!"@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@He yanked his arms free.
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:"Grow!" he cried.@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@His iron bar quickly grew.
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[i@Whap!@i] He knocked out the first spirit.@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[i@Crack!@i] He knocked out the second spirit.
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@As he went, he swung his iron bar back and forth.
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:Demons and ghosts fled.@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@"I want to know why I was brought here," said Wukong.
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:"Tell me now!"@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@The judge looked nervous.
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:"Let's check the Directory," he said.@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@Wukong told him.
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:The judge flipped through the pages.@g]
C0006427_Journey to the West 7.srt:[g@"Here it is," said the judge.

C0006709_Journey to the West 63.srt:[g@Higher up the mountain was a large monastery.

C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@The Tang Monk shivered and hugged himself.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:"I'm so cold," he said.@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@"I'm not sure.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:Wukong believed it though."@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@Bajie nodded. "It looks warm too.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:Maybe the monks there will take us in."@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@"That settles it," said the pig.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:"Who cares what that monkey thinks?@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@What does he know?
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:Let's go up there, get warm, and eat some food."@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:The Tang Monk climbed back onto the horse, and the three [n@travelers headed toward the monastery.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@"Hello!" the pig called. "Is anybody in there?"
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:Again there was no answer.@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@Bajie looked at his companions.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:"Maybe the monks didn't hear me."@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@His eyes lit up.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:"Maybe they're all in the kitchen, cooking food!@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@The pig's stomach growled again.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:"I'll go in and find out."@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@He opened the door and stepped inside.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:The monastery was dark and silent.@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@Then he saw a room that was lit up.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:He went inside.@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@He shivered. "They also look warm."

C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@Bajie handed a vest to the Tang Monk.

C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@The monk frowned.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:You stole it!"@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@"I didn't steal it," said Bajie.

C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@He put his arm through the armhole.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:Wujing did the same.@g]
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@Bajie put his other arm through.

C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:[g@The demon clasped his hands together.
C0006710_Journey to the West 64.srt:"You're the Tang Monk!"@g]
C0006711_Journey to the West 65.srt:"I've been hoping you would pass my mountain," [n@the demon said with an evil smile.
C0006711_Journey to the West 65.srt:[g@The demon turned to face him.
C0006711_Journey to the West 65.srt:"I am One-Horned Buffalo."@g]
C0006711_Journey to the West 65.srt:[g@"Our friend will find us soon," said Bajie.

C0006712_Journey to the West 66.srt:[g@"He stole my iron bar!" cried Wukong.

C0007003_Journey to the West 89.srt:[i@Wham!@i] There was a puff of smoke.
