1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:18,354
The travelers laid the soaked scrolls on some rocks.

2
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:21,911
"The sun will dry them out," said Wukong.

3
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:24,168
The Tang Monk moaned.

4
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:26,681
"What if they're ruined?"

5
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:30,262
He sat down and put his head in his hands.

6
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:35,137
"I wish I'd remembered to ask Buddha the turtle's question!"

7
00:00:35,138 --> 00:00:37,603
Bajie snorted.

8
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:40,641
"Who cares if you forgot the turtle's question?

9
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:44,867
That turtle had no right to dump us in the water!"

10
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:48,772
"Dumping us in the water was rude," Wujing agreed.

11
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:51,315
Bajie sighed.

12
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:56,189
"The journey back east is becoming just as difficult as the journey west."

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,605
"Hello!" cried a voice.

14
00:00:58,606 --> 00:01:03,585
The travelers turned and saw a man hurrying toward them.

15
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:05,900
"Chen," said the Tang Monk.

16
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:08,506
He grasped the man's hands.

17
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:11,017
"It's good to see you again."

18
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:14,550
"It's good to see all of you." Chen smiled.

19
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,496
"Did you reach the Western Paradise?"

20
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:19,751
"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

21
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:21,703
"It was magnificent!

22
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:24,593
The land is filled with beauty."

23
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:30,121
Chen noticed the scrolls lying on the rocks, and his eyes went wide.

24
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:34,763
"Are those the True Scriptures?" he whispered.

25
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:36,806
"Yes," said the monk.

26
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:41,741
"But as you can see, they got wet."

27
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:47,547
"A giant turtle dumped us in the river," added Bajie with a sigh.

28
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:50,195
"Please come with me," said Chen.

29
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:53,179
"You can dry the True Scriptures by my fire.

30
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,985
Everyone in the village will be excited to see the travelers who met Buddha."

31
00:01:57,986 --> 00:02:01,976
Wujing started gathering the wet scriptures.

32
00:02:01,977 --> 00:02:04,957
"I'll help you," said Bajie.

33
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,265
The pig grabbed a scroll and pulled.

34
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:11,022
But it was stuck to a rock.

35
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:17,799
Rip! The corner of the scroll tore off.

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,132
The Tang Monk gasped. "Oh no!"

37
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:26,539
Bajie stared in horror at the torn scroll.

38
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,955
Wukong smiled. "Don't worry, Master."

39
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:35,088
The monkey gently picked the rest of the scroll off the rock.

40
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,381
"The scroll is fine."

41
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:40,371
"But it's ripped!" cried the monk.

42
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:44,046
Bajie hung his head.

43
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,478
"Tell me something, Master," said Wukong.

44
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,036
"Are you perfect?"

45
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:52,465
The monk gave Wukong a confused look.

46
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,455
"Of course not."

47
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:58,024
"Am I perfect?" asked the monkey.

48
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:02,169
The Tang Monk shook his head.

49
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,088
"How about Bajie?" Wukong smirked.

50
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:09,676
"We all know he's not perfect."

51
00:03:09,677 --> 00:03:12,370
The pig snorted.

52
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:16,284
"Nothing on Earth or in Heaven is perfect," said Wukong.

53
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:19,894
"So why should the True Scriptures be any different?

54
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:24,016
They'll teach the people of the East how to be good and avoid suffering.

55
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:32,379
They will also teach the people that nothing needs to be perfect."

56
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:40,490
The travelers finished gathering the scrolls and followed Chen back to the village.

57
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:44,586
People came out of their homes to see the travelers.

58
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:47,408
"Welcome back!" called a woman.

59
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:51,887
"It's wonderful to see you all again!" shouted an old man.

60
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:59,320
Soon a crowd was following the Tang Monk and his companions to Chen's house.

61
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:03,625
That evening the villagers held a big feast.

62
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:08,532
Later that night Wukong and the Tang Monk sat, talking.

63
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:11,142
"We must leave soon," said the monk.

64
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:14,561
"The villagers will want to see the True Scriptures.

65
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:17,964
They'll become jealous that we have them."

66
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:20,618
"I agree," said Wukong.

67
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:26,129
He remembered the priest who'd tried to kill the Tang Monk and steal the robe.

68
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,786
"Let's sneak away now, while the villagers are asleep," said Wukong.

69
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:35,114
The monk and the monkey woke up Bajie and Wujing.

70
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:39,429
The group sneaked out of Chen's house and headed east.

71
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,854
It was dark, but the light from the full moon lit up the road.

72
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:49,021
Suddenly the guard from the Thunderclap Monastery appeared.

73
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,617
"Congratulations!" said the guard.

74
00:04:52,618 --> 00:04:56,487
"You have faced one hundred challenges."

75
00:04:56,488 --> 00:05:00,271
"Whew." The monk sighed with relief.

76
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:03,392
"I will become a buddha at last."

77
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:06,427
The guard recited a spell.

78
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:16,312
Once again the travelers flew toward the East.
