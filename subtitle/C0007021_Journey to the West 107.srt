00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 206:08:30,933.3329999446869
The travelers laid the soaked scrolls on some rocks.

2
206:10:10,933.3329999446869 --> 304:56:50,933.3329999446869
"The sun will dry them out," said Wukong.

3
304:58:30,933.3329999446869 --> 367:38:30,933.3329999446869
[g@The Tang Monk moaned.

4
367:40:10,933.3329999446869 --> 437:26:50,933.3329999446869
"What if they're ruined?"@g]

5
437:28:30,933.3329999446869 --> 536:55:10,933.3329999446869
He sat down and put his head in his hands.

6
536:56:50,933.3329999446869 --> 672:20:10,933.3330001831055
"I wish I'd remembered to ask Buddha the turtle's question!"

7
672:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 740:50:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie snorted.

8
740:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 825:13:30,933.3330001831055
"Who cares if you forgot the turtle's question?@g]

9
825:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 942:36:50,933.3330001831055
That turtle had no right to dump us in the water!"

10
942:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1051:05:10,933.3330001831055
"Dumping us in the water was rude," Wujing agreed.

11
1051:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1121:43:30,933.3330001831055
Bajie sighed.

12
1121:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1257:06:50,933.3330001831055
"The journey back east is becoming just as difficult as the journey west."

13
1257:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1324:13:30,933.3330001831055
"Hello!" cried a voice.

14
1324:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1462:33:30,933.3330001831055
The travelers turned and saw a man hurrying toward them.

15
1462:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1526:51:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Chen," said the Tang Monk.

16
1526:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1599:15:10,933.3330001831055
He grasped the man's hands.@g]

17
1599:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1669:00:10,933.3330001831055
"It's good to see you again."

18
1669:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1767:08:30,933.3330001831055
"It's good to see all of you." Chen smiled.

19
1767:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1848:58:30,933.3330001831055
"Did you reach the Western Paradise?"

20
1849:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1911:36:50,933.3330001831055
"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

21
1911:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1965:50:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"It was magnificent!

22
1965:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2046:06:50,933.3330001831055
The land is filled with beauty."@g]

23
2046:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2199:40:10,933.3330001831055
Chen noticed the scrolls lying on the rocks, and his eyes went wide.

24
2199:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2328:36:50,933.3330001831055
"Are those the True Scriptures?" he whispered.

25
2328:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2385:21:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Yes," said the monk.

26
2385:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2522:26:50,933.3330001831055
"But as you can see, they got wet."@g]

27
2522:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2683:43:30,933.3330001831055
"A giant turtle dumped us in the river," added Bajie with a sigh.

28
2683:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2757:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Please come with me," said Chen.

29
2757:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2840:10:10,933.3330001831055
"You can dry the True Scriptures by my fire.

30
2840:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2973:40:10,933.3330001831055
Everyone in the village will be excited to see [n@the travelers who met Buddha."

31
2973:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3084:31:50,933.3330001831055
Wujing started gathering the wet scriptures.

32
3084:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3167:20:10,933.3330001831055
"I'll help you," said Bajie.

33
3167:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3259:13:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The pig grabbed a scroll and pulled.

34
3259:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3335:48:30,933.3330001831055
But it was stuck to a rock.@g]

35
3335:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3524:03:30,933.3330001831055
[i@Rip!@i] The corner of the scroll tore off.

36
3524:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3644:25:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk gasped. "Oh no!"

37
3644:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3766:50:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie stared in horror at the torn scroll.

38
3766:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3889:30:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong smiled. "Don't worry, Master."

39
3889:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4004:18:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey gently picked the rest of the scroll off the rock.

40
4004:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4068:00:10,933.3330001831055
"The scroll is fine."

41
4068:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4151:03:30,933.3330001831055
"But it's ripped!" cried the monk.

42
4151:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4253:08:30,933.3330001831055
Bajie hung his head.

43
4253:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4320:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Tell me something, Master," said Wukong.

44
4320:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4391:45:10,933.3330001831055
"Are you perfect?"@g]

45
4391:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4487:00:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The monk gave Wukong a confused look.

46
4487:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4542:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Of course not."@g]

47
4542:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4641:25:10,933.3330001831055
"Am I perfect?" asked the monkey.

48
4641:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4756:33:30,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk shook his head.

49
4756:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4865:25:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"How about Bajie?" Wukong smirked.

50
4865:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4965:05:10,933.3330001831055
"We all know he's not perfect."@g]

51
4965:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5039:55:10,933.3330001831055
The pig snorted.

52
5039:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5148:38:30,933.3330001831055
"Nothing on Earth or in Heaven is perfect," said Wukong.

53
5148:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5248:55:10,933.3330001831055
"So why should the True Scriptures be any different?

54
5248:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5363:25:10,933.3330001831055
They'll teach the people of the East how to be good and avoid suffering.

55
5363:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5595:43:30,933.3330001831055
They will also teach the people that nothing needs to be perfect."

56
5595:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5821:01:50,933.3330001831055
The travelers finished gathering the scrolls [n@and followed Chen back to the village.

57
5821:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5934:48:30,933.3330001831055
People came out of their homes to see the travelers.

58
5934:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6013:11:50,933.3330001831055
"Welcome back!" called a woman.

59
6013:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6137:36:50,933.3330001831055
"It's wonderful to see you all again!" shouted an old man.

60
6137:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6344:05:10,933.3330001831055
Soon a crowd was following the Tang Monk [n@and his companions to Chen's house.

61
6344:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6463:40:10,933.3330001831055
That evening the villagers held a big feast.

62
6463:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6599:58:30,933.3330001831055
Later that night Wukong and the Tang Monk sat, talking.

63
6600:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6672:28:30,933.3330001831055
"We must leave soon," said the monk.

64
6672:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6767:26:50,933.3330001831055
"The villagers will want to see the True Scriptures.

65
6767:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6861:58:30,933.3330001831055
They'll become jealous that we have them."

66
6862:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6935:41:50,933.3330001831055
"I agree," said Wukong.

67
6935:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7088:46:50,933.3330001831055
He remembered the priest who'd tried to kill [n@the Tang Monk and steal the robe.

68
7088:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7218:08:30,933.3330001831055
"Let's sneak away now, while the villagers are asleep," said Wukong.

69
7218:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7338:21:50,933.3330001831055
The monk and the monkey woke up Bajie and Wujing.

70
7338:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7458:13:30,933.3330001831055
The group sneaked out of Chen's house and headed east.

71
7458:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7608:55:10,933.3330001831055
It was dark, but the light from the full moon lit up the road.

72
7608:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7724:40:10,933.3330001831055
Suddenly the guard from the Thunderclap Monastery appeared.

73
7724:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7824:33:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Congratulations!" said the guard.

74
7824:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7932:03:30,933.3330001831055
"You have faced one hundred challenges."@g]

75
7932:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8037:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Whew." The monk sighed with relief.

76
8037:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8123:51:50,933.3330001831055
"I will become a buddha at last."@g]

77
8123:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8208:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The guard recited a spell.

78
8208:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8482:45:10,933.3330001831055
Once again the travelers flew toward the East.@g]
