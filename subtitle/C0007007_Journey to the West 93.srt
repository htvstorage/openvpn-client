00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:15,599
The elephant and the raptor stared at the lion.

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,960
[g@"Sun Wukong is alive inside you," said the raptor.

3
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:27,556
"Aren't you worried?"@g]

4
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:29,807
[g@The lion sat down on his throne.

5
00:00:29,808 --> 00:00:32,084
"Worried about what?"@g]

6
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:34,478
"Well," said the raptor.

7
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,661
[g@"The monkey is talking inside you.

8
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,388
Doesn't that bother you?"@g]

9
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:43,942
[g@"Let him talk," said the lion defiantly.

10
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,846
"It doesn't bother me at all."@g]

11
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:50,031
[g@"What shall I talk about?" Wukong called.

12
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:52,355
"Who wants to hear a story?"@g]

13
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:55,266
The elephant shook his head slowly.

14
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:58,727
[g@"What if the monkey never stops talking?

15
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:01,929
You'll never get any sleep."@g]

16
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,623
[g@"Hmm," said the lion. "That would be bad."

17
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:09,004
He thought for a moment.@g]

18
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:10,366
[g@"I know what to do.

19
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:13,611
I'll stop eating."@g]

20
00:01:13,612 --> 00:01:17,234
"What will that do?" asked the elephant.

21
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:21,592
"Yes," said Wukong. "What will that do?"

22
00:01:21,593 --> 00:01:26,687
[g@"If I don't eat, Wukong doesn't eat," said the lion.

23
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:29,747
"I'll make him starve."@g]

24
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:32,811
[g@Wukong laughed.

25
00:01:32,812 --> 00:01:34,360
"Nice try, lion!@g]

26
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,851
But I'll just turn one of my hairs into a stove.

27
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:41,936
I'll cook a nice meal in here!"

28
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:45,257
"Oh dear." The raptor shook his head.

29
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:50,936
"If that monkey fires up a stove, it will make you very hot.

30
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:53,804
Plus it will create lots of smoke.

31
00:01:53,805 --> 00:02:00,949
The smoke will fill your head, and you'll never stop sneezing!"

32
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,563
At last the lion was starting to look nervous.

33
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:07,919
[g@"That would be terrible," he said.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,355
"I'd better cough out Wukong."@g]

35
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:13,901
The lion went to the middle of the room.

36
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:19,914
He bent over and coughed. "Ahugh! Ahugh!"

37
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:22,339
[g@Wukong laughed.

38
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,177
"I'm still in here!"@g]

39
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:31,063
"Ahugh! Ahugh!" The lion coughed again.

40
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:35,596
But still Wukong stayed inside him.

41
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:40,148
"I'm going to practice my fighting skills," announced the monkey.

42
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:43,465
[g@[i@Boomph! Pow! Boomph! Pow!@i]

43
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:47,250
Wukong punched and kicked inside the lion.@g]

44
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,583
The lion fell to his knees.

45
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:55,074
[g@"Ohh!" he moaned. "It hurts! It hurts!

46
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,265
Wukong, please stop!"@g]

47
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:01,443
"Let's make a deal," said Wukong.

48
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:05,896
"I'll come out if you promise to let us cross the mountain safely."

49
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:09,059
[g@The lion looked up at the raptor and the elephant.

50
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,945
They both nodded.@g]

51
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:16,232
"We promise." The lion moaned again.

52
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:18,597
[g@"Okay then," said Wukong.

53
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,126
"I'm coming out."@g]

54
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:24,704
Wukong started the climb up the lion's throat.

55
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:29,728
Just as he reached the lion's mouth, Wukong heard whispering.

56
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:33,904
"Lion, I have a plan," whispered the elephant.

57
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:38,178
"When Wukong tries to come out of your mouth, bite him."

58
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:40,940
"I don't know . . . ," whispered the lion.

59
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:43,061
[g@"Wukong is very strong.

60
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:45,585
My belly still hurts."@g]

61
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:50,185
"Chomp him quickly, before he can fight back," whispered the elephant.

62
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:53,578
"Okay," said the lion.

63
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:56,950
"Those dumb demons," thought Wukong.

64
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:59,755
[g@"Don't they realize I can hear them?"

65
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:02,311
He pulled out his iron bar.@g]

66
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:05,839
"Shall I come out now?" asked the monkey.

67
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,534
[g@"Um, yes," said the lion.

68
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:12,951
Wukong heard the three demons snickering.@g]

69
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:17,807
[g@"Okay," said Wukong. "I'm coming out."

70
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:21,842
He held out the iron bar.@g]

71
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:24,171
The lion bit down hard on the bar.

72
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:30,160
[i@Crack!@i] A tooth shattered into tiny pieces.

73
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:37,096
[g@"Ow! Ow! Ow!" the lion howled in pain.

74
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:39,592
Tears streamed down his face.@g]

75
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:44,666
He rolled around on the floor, holding his paws over his mouth.

76
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,381
[g@"You villains!" Wukong shouted.

77
00:04:47,382 --> 00:04:50,019
"I heard you whispering!"@g]

78
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,166
"I'm sorry." The lion was still crying.

79
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:56,930
[g@"I won't try to bite you again.

80
00:04:56,931 --> 00:05:01,257
Please don't hurt me anymore."@g]

81
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:03,181
[g@Wukong hesitated.

82
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:05,317
"I'm coming out now.@g]

83
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:09,119
You'd better not try any more tricks!"

84
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,732
"We won't," said the elephant.

85
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:15,169
"We promise," said the raptor.

86
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,042
Wukong popped out of the lion's nose.

87
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:28,428
He glared at the demons for a moment and then walked out of the cave.

88
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:35,345
As soon as the monkey was gone, the elephant [n@turned to the other two demons.

89
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:42,683
"I have a new plan for capturing the Tang Monk."
