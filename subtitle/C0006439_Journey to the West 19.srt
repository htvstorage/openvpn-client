1
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:20,114
The head priest called for two other priests, who quickly ran into the room.

2
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:24,053
"Is everything okay, Master?" one priest asked.

3
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:29,048
"I can't give this robe back to the Tang Monk," said the head priest.

4
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:34,999
"But you must give it back," said the other priest.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,117
"This robe is a Buddhist treasure," said the head priest.

6
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:42,098
"It comes from the Western Paradise.

7
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:47,374
As Buddhists, we must do everything we can to keep it in our monastery."

8
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:51,231
"The Tang Monk won't let you keep it," said the first priest.

9
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:53,827
[g@The head priest smiled.

10
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:57,208
There was an evil look in his eyes.@g]

11
00:00:57,209 --> 00:01:01,769
"I have a plan," he said.

12
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,070
Wukong was awake, meditating on a rooftop, when he heard footsteps.

13
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:11,973
He looked down and saw two priests walking across the courtyard.

14
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:15,337
They were carrying bundles of firewood.

15
00:01:15,338 --> 00:01:19,048
"It's the middle of the night," thought Wukong.

16
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,936
"Why are they starting a fire?"

17
00:01:21,937 --> 00:01:27,303
The priests stacked the firewood next to the [n@building the Tang Monk was sleeping in.

18
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:30,104
[g@"Aha!" thought Wukong.

19
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:33,139
"I'll bet that head priest wants to keep our robe.@g]

20
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,537
He's planning to kill us."

21
00:01:35,538 --> 00:01:41,163
Wukong waited until the priests lit the wood on fire.

22
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:46,297
Then he used his magic powers.

23
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:51,816
The priests screamed and ran as the fire shot across the courtyard.

24
00:01:51,817 --> 00:01:56,509
One building went up in flames, and then another.

25
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:02,044
Soon most of the monastery's buildings were on fire.

26
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:06,869
Walls crumbled and roofs caved in.

27
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,589
"Run for your life!" cried one priest.

28
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,097
"Our monastery is ruined!" cried another.

29
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:18,205
There was one building, however, that the fire didn't touch.

30
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:25,763
The Tang Monk slept peacefully as the rest of the monastery burned down.

31
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:32,076
[g@The next morning the Tang Monk woke up and opened the door.

32
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:34,219
He gasped.@g]

33
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,315
[g@Smoke drifted through the air.

34
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:40,887
Burned pieces of wood lay in heaps.@g]

35
00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:44,626
The buildings' walls were black and crumbled.

36
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:47,245
[g@"Oh no!" cried the Tang Monk.

37
00:02:47,246 --> 00:02:49,916
"What happened to the monastery?"@g]

38
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:52,027
He turned around.

39
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:57,926
That's when he realized that the building he'd slept in was fine.

40
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:04,002
Wukong walked over.

41
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:08,261
"Wukong!" cried the monk. "What happened here?"

42
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:12,004
"The head priest tried to kill you," said Wukong.

43
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:16,078
"He tried to set the building you were in on fire."

44
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:19,265
The Tang Monk was confused.

45
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,855
[g@"But that building is fine.

46
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:22,900
The fire didn't touch it."@g]

47
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:28,008
Wukong laughed. "I used my magic to stop the fire."

48
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,661
[g@The Tang Monk scratched his head.

49
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:33,150
"The rest of the buildings burned."@g]

50
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:37,412
"I used my magic for that too," said Wukong with a smile.

51
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:41,739
"I used a spell that protected only your building and the robe.

52
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,519
The spell made the fire spread everywhere else, though."

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,704
[g@The Tang Monk's eyes filled with tears.

54
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:50,919
He looked angry.@g]

55
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,014
"That's horrible, Wukong!" he cried.

56
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:58,392
"If you had the power to stop the fire, you should have stopped all of it!"

57
00:03:58,393 --> 00:04:02,150
[g@Wukong shrugged. "The priests here are evil.

58
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:05,738
They deserved what they got."@g]

59
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:08,186
[g@Just then they heard a shout.

60
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:11,304
Two of the priests ran toward them.@g]

61
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:13,812
"Villains!" cried Wukong.

62
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:16,726
[g@"How dare you try to burn my master!

63
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:20,855
I should club you with my iron bar!"@g]

64
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:24,075
The two priests fell to their knees and bowed.

65
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:27,044
"Please forgive us!" one cried.

66
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:30,554
"We didn't want to harm you or the Tang Monk.

67
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:34,442
It was the head priest's idea! He's evil!"

68
00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:38,353
[g@Wukong glared at the two priests for a moment.

69
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:40,115
Then he relaxed.@g]

70
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:43,773
"Stand up," he said. "I believe you.

71
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:47,979
Just bring us the robe so we can continue our journey to the West."

72
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,995
[g@"We . . . we can't," said one priest.

73
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:52,925
He was shaking.@g]

74
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:59,491
"The robe is gone!"
