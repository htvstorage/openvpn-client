00:00:11,050.66700000000128 --> 251:45:11,050.66700005531311
The head priest called for two other priests, who quickly ran into the room.

2
251:46:51,050.66700005531311 --> 361:10:11,050.66700005531311
"Is everything okay, Master?" one priest asked.

3
361:11:51,050.66700005531311 --> 499:55:11,050.66700005531311
"I can't give this robe back to the Tang Monk," said the head priest.

4
499:56:51,050.66700005531311 --> 665:13:31,050.66699981689453
"But you must give it back," said the other priest.

5
665:15:11,050.66699981689453 --> 779:36:51,050.66699981689453
"This robe is a Buddhist treasure," said the head priest.

6
779:38:31,050.66699981689453 --> 862:25:11,050.66699981689453
"It comes from the Western Paradise.

7
862:26:51,050.66699981689453 --> 1008:58:31,050.66699981689453
As Buddhists, we must do everything we can to keep it in our monastery."

8
1009:00:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1116:06:51,050.66699981689453
"The Tang Monk won't let you keep it," said the first priest.

9
1116:08:31,050.66699981689453 --> 1188:13:31,050.66699981689453
[g@The head priest smiled.

10
1188:15:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1282:08:31,050.66699981689453
There was an evil look in his eyes.@g]

11
1282:10:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1408:50:11,050.66699981689453
"I have a plan," he said.

12
1408:51:51,050.66699981689453 --> 1556:05:11,050.66699981689453
Wukong was awake, meditating on a rooftop, when he heard footsteps.

13
1556:06:51,050.66699981689453 --> 1692:16:51,050.66699981689453
He looked down and saw two priests walking across the courtyard.

14
1692:18:31,050.66699981689453 --> 1785:43:31,050.66699981689453
They were carrying bundles of firewood.

15
1785:45:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1888:48:31,050.66699981689453
"It's the middle of the night," thought Wukong.

16
1888:50:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1969:01:51,050.66699981689453
"Why are they starting a fire?"

17
1969:03:31,050.66699981689453 --> 2118:06:51,050.66699981689453
The priests stacked the firewood next to the [n@building the Tang Monk was sleeping in.

2118:08:31,050.66699981689453 --> 2195:55:11,050.66699981689453
[g@"Aha!" thought Wukong.

19
2195:56:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2280:13:31,050.66699981689453
"I'll bet that head priest wants to keep our robe.@g]

20
2280:15:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2346:50:11,050.66699981689453
He's planning to kill us."

21
2346:51:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2503:06:51,050.66699981689453
Wukong waited until the priests lit the wood on fire.

22
2503:08:31,050.66699981689453 --> 2645:43:31,050.66699981689453
Then he used his magic powers.

23
2645:45:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2799:01:51,050.66699981689453
The priests screamed and ran as the fire shot across the courtyard.

24
2799:03:31,050.66699981689453 --> 2929:23:31,050.66699981689453
One building went up in flames, and then another.

25
2929:25:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3083:08:31,050.66699981689453
Soon most of the monastery's buildings were on fire.

26
3083:10:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3217:10:11,050.66699981689453
Walls crumbled and roofs caved in.

27
3217:11:51,050.66699981689453 --> 3320:30:11,050.66699981689453
"Run for your life!" cried one priest.

28
3320:31:51,050.66699981689453 --> 3417:56:51,050.66699981689453
"Our monastery is ruined!" cried another.

29
3417:58:31,050.66699981689453 --> 3532:03:31,050.66699981689453
There was one building, however, that the fire didn't touch.

30
3532:05:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3742:00:11,050.66699981689453
The Tang Monk slept peacefully as the rest of the monastery burned down.

31
3742:01:51,050.66699981689453 --> 3917:21:51,050.66699981689453
[g@The next morning the Tang Monk woke up and opened the door.

3917:23:31,050.66699981689453 --> 3976:53:31,050.66699981689453
He gasped.@g]

3976:55:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4062:53:31,050.66699981689453
[g@Smoke drifted through the air.

4062:55:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4162:06:51,050.66699981689453
Burned pieces of wood lay in heaps.@g]

4162:08:31,050.66699981689453 --> 4265:58:31,050.66699981689453
The buildings' walls were black and crumbled.

36
4266:00:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4338:43:31,050.66699981689453
[g@"Oh no!" cried the Tang Monk.

37
4338:45:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4412:55:11,050.66699981689453
"What happened to the monastery?"@g]

38
4412:56:51,050.66699981689453 --> 4471:33:31,050.66699981689453
He turned around.

39
4471:35:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4635:25:11,050.66699981689453
That's when he realized that the building he'd slept in was fine.

40
4635:26:51,050.66699981689453 --> 4804:11:51,050.66699981689453
Wukong walked over.

41
4804:13:31,050.66699981689453 --> 4922:30:11,050.66699981689453
"Wukong!" cried the monk. "What happened here?"

42
4922:31:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5026:28:31,050.66699981689453
"The head priest tried to kill you," said Wukong.

43
5026:30:11,050.66699981689453 --> 5139:38:31,050.66699981689453
"He tried to set the building you were in on fire."

44
5139:40:11,050.66699981689453 --> 5228:10:11,050.66699981689453
The Tang Monk was confused.

45
5228:11:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5272:20:11,050.66699981689453

5329:10:11,050.66699981689453 --> 5471:01:51,050.66699981689453
Wukong laughed. "I used my magic to stop the fire."

48
5471:03:31,050.66699981689453 --> 5544:43:31,050.66699981689453

"I used my magic for that too," said Wukong with a smile.

51
5732:16:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5852:26:51,050.66699981689453
"I used a spell that protected only your building and the robe.

5852:28:31,050.66699981689453 --> 5957:26:51,050.66699981689453
The spell made the fire spread everywhere else, though."
