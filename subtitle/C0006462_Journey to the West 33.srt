1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:19,319
After the Tang Monk sent Wukong away, he and the others continued west.

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,872
Later that day they stopped to rest.

3
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:31,383
[g@Bajie sat down in the grass next to the road.

4
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:35,450
He let out a great big yawn.@g]

5
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:38,333
"Bajie," said the Tang Monk.

6
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:40,902
[g@"Why don't you go find us some food?

7
00:00:40,903 --> 00:00:43,242
Wujing and I will wait here."@g]

8
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:49,898
[g@The pig moaned. "Ugh! I just sat down!"

9
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,229
He got back up.@g]

10
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,849
[g@"This journey is too difficult," he said.

11
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,686
Then he wandered off.@g]

12
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:04,600
[g@After a few minutes of walking, Bajie looked around.

13
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:06,965
He was all alone.@g]

14
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:11,033
"I'm too tired to look for food," he said to himself.

15
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:15,668
"But if I go back now, Master will be angry."

16
00:01:15,669 --> 00:01:20,143
[g@He yawned. "I'll take a nap.

17
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:23,302
When I wake up, I'll go back to Master.@g]

18
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:36,490
I'll tell him I searched everywhere but couldn't find any food."

19
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:41,670
[g@The pig lay down behind some bushes.

20
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:47,687
Soon he was snoring loudly.@g]

21
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:54,752
An hour later the Tang Monk and Wujing were still waiting by the road.

22
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:58,449
"What is taking Bajie so long?" asked the monk.

23
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,744
Wujing looked annoyed.

24
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:05,355
"He probably found food and is now eating it all himself.

25
00:02:05,356 --> 00:02:08,737
I'll go and look for him."

26
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:16,087
Wujing got up and headed down the road.

27
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:21,859
"Mmm," said a voice suddenly. "Yummy noodles!"

28
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,224
Wujing frowned. "That's Bajie.

29
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:31,404
He [i@did@i] find food, and he's not sharing it with us!"

30
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:35,118
Meanwhile the Tang Monk became bored.

31
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:38,750
[g@He stood up to stretch his legs.

32
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:40,592
He looked around.@g]

33
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:44,188
"This is a beautiful forest," he said to himself.

34
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:49,636
"I'll take a short walk."

35
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:58,047
The monk walked quietly through the woods, [n@admiring flowers and plants as he went.

36
00:02:58,048 --> 00:03:03,134
He went deeper and deeper into the forest.

37
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:08,144
Then, in the midst of all the trees, he saw a pagoda.

38
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:12,352
"This is a strange place for a pagoda," he thought.

39
00:03:12,353 --> 00:03:17,518
"Maybe we can all stay here tonight."

40
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:25,137
The Tang Monk went to the door of the pagoda and opened it.

41
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:29,586
He gasped. A monster was sleeping inside!

42
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:34,696
The monster had a purple beard and long, sharp fangs.

43
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:39,049
The Tang Monk tried to walk away, but the monster woke up.

44
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,616
[g@"Who's there?" called the monster.

45
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:44,842
He stood up.@g]

46
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:49,076
The Tang Monk turned around, shaking with fear.

47
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:54,072
"Sorry to wake you," he said. "I, uh . . ."

48
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:57,225
The monster came closer and smiled.

49
00:03:57,226 --> 00:04:00,044
[g@"You're a monk," he said.

50
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:02,459
He licked his lips.@g]

51
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:08,871
"Y-yes," said the Tang Monk. "I'm from the T-Tang Empire. I . . ."

52
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:11,112
[g@The monster's eyes lit up.

53
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:15,333
"You're the Tang Monk!"@g]

54
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:21,190
Meanwhile Wujing stomped toward Bajie's voice.

55
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:26,916
He peered behind some bushes and saw the pig fast asleep.

56
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:30,892
[g@"May I have more tofu?" asked Bajie.

57
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,136
He was talking in his sleep.@g]

58
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:35,265
[g@"Yes, please cook lots more.

59
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:37,856
I will eat it all."@g]

60
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:42,101
Wujing kicked the pig. "Wake up!"

61
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:46,878
Bajie jumped to his feet, wiping drool from the side of his mouth.

62
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,535
"How dare you sleep while we wait for you?" said Wujing.

63
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:55,622
"Now let's go back to Master."

64
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:57,400
[g@The pig sighed.

65
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:02,676
With his head hung low, he followed Wujing back to the road.@g]

66
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:08,621
But when they got there, the Tang Monk was gone.

67
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:13,292
"Maybe he went for a walk," said Wujing.

68
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:18,802
He and Bajie wandered through the woods, looking for the monk.

69
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:22,634
Soon they saw the pagoda.

70
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:27,958
They knocked on the door, and the monster answered.

71
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,771
"Who are you?" asked the monster.

72
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:34,779
[g@Wujing told the monster who they were.

73
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,128
"We're looking for a monk."@g]

74
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,804
The monster laughed.

75
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,755
[g@"I have a monk here.

76
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:49,747
I'm going to eat him for dinner!"@g]
