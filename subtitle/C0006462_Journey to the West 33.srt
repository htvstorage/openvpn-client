00:00:11,266.66699999999946 --> 223:40:11,266.6670000553131
After the Tang Monk sent Wukong away, he and the others continued west.

2
223:41:51,266.6670000553131 --> 433:28:31,266.6670000553131
Later that day they stopped to rest.

3
433:30:11,266.6670000553131 --> 558:46:51,266.6670000553131
[g@Bajie sat down in the grass next to the road.

558:48:31,266.6670000553131 --> 671:45:11,266.66699981689453
He let out a great big yawn.@g]

5
671:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 751:50:11,266.66699981689453
"Bajie," said the Tang Monk.

6
751:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 823:11:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"Why don't you go find us some food?

7
823:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 888:11:51,266.66699981689453
Wujing and I will wait here."@g]

888:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1073:05:11,266.66699981689453
[g@The pig moaned. "Ugh! I just sat down!"

9
1073:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1137:50:11,266.66699981689453
He got back up.@g]

10
1137:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1238:23:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"This journey is too difficult," he said.

11
1238:25:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1344:58:31,266.66699981689453
Then he wandered off.@g]

12
1345:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1481:28:31,266.66699981689453
[g@After a few minutes of walking, Bajie looked around.

13
1481:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1547:10:11,266.66699981689453
He was all alone.@g]

14
1547:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1660:10:11,266.66699981689453
"I'm too tired to look for food," he said to himself.

15
1660:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1788:55:11,266.66699981689453
"But if I go back now, Master will be angry."

16
1788:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1913:13:31,266.66699981689453
[g@He yawned. "I'll take a nap.

17
1913:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2000:58:31,266.66699981689453
When I wake up, I'll go back to Master.@g]

18
2001:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2367:18:31,266.66699981689453
I'll tell him I searched everywhere but couldn't find any food."

19
2367:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2511:11:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The pig lay down behind some bushes.

20
2511:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2678:20:11,266.66699981689453
Soon he was snoring loudly.@g]

21
2678:21:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2874:35:11,266.66699981689453
An hour later the Tang Monk and Wujing were still waiting by the road.

22
2874:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2977:16:51,266.66699981689453
"What is taking Bajie so long?" asked the monk.

23
2977:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3041:01:51,266.66699981689453
Wujing looked annoyed.

24
3041:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3169:06:51,266.66699981689453
"He probably found food and is now eating it all himself.

25
3169:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3263:03:31,266.66699981689453
I'll go and look for him."

26
3263:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3467:13:31,266.66699981689453
Wujing got up and headed down the road.

27
3467:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3627:33:31,266.66699981689453
"Mmm," said a voice suddenly. "Yummy noodles!"

28
3627:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3748:48:31,266.66699981689453
Wujing frowned. "That's Bajie.

29
3748:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3892:41:51,266.66699981689453
He [i@did@i] find food, and he's not sharing it with us!"

30
3892:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3995:51:51,266.66699981689453
Meanwhile the Tang Monk became bored.

31
3995:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4096:45:11,266.66699981689453
[g@He stood up to stretch his legs.

32
4096:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4147:55:11,266.66699981689453
He looked around.@g]

33
4147:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4247:48:31,266.66699981689453
"This is a beautiful forest," he said to himself.

34
4247:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4399:08:31,266.66699981689453
"I'll take a short walk."

35
4399:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4632:46:51,266.66699981689453
The monk walked quietly through the woods, [n@admiring flowers and plants as he went.

36
4632:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4774:05:11,266.66699981689453
He went deeper and deeper into the forest.

37
4774:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4913:15:11,266.66699981689453
Then, in the midst of all the trees, he saw a pagoda.

38
4913:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5030:08:31,266.66699981689453
"This is a strange place for a pagoda," he thought.

39
5030:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5173:38:31,266.66699981689453
"Maybe we can all stay here tonight."

40
5173:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5385:16:51,266.66699981689453
The Tang Monk went to the door of the pagoda and opened it.

41
5385:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5508:51:51,266.66699981689453
He gasped. A monster was sleeping inside!

42
5508:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5650:48:31,266.66699981689453
The monster had a purple beard and long, sharp fangs.

43
5650:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5771:43:31,266.66699981689453
The Tang Monk tried to walk away, but the monster woke up.

44
5771:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5870:48:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"Who's there?" called the monster.

45
5870:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5932:38:31,266.66699981689453
He stood up.@g]

46
5932:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6050:15:11,266.66699981689453
The Tang Monk turned around, shaking with fear.

47
6050:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6189:01:51,266.66699981689453
"Sorry to wake you," he said. "I, uh . . ."

48
6189:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6276:36:51,266.66699981689453
The monster came closer and smiled.

49
6276:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6354:55:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"You're a monk," he said.

50
6354:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6422:00:11,266.66699981689453
He licked his lips.@g]

51
6422:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6600:06:51,266.66699981689453
"Y-yes," said the Tang Monk. "I'm from the T-Tang Empire. I . . ."

52
6600:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6662:21:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The monster's eyes lit up.

53
6662:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6779:36:51,266.66699981689453
"You're the Tang Monk!"@g]

54
6779:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6942:18:31,266.66699981689453
Meanwhile Wujing stomped toward Bajie's voice.

55
6942:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7101:21:51,266.66699981689453
He peered behind some bushes and saw the pig fast asleep.

56
7101:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7211:48:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"May I have more tofu?" asked Bajie.

57
7211:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7274:08:31,266.66699981689453
He was talking in his sleep.@g]

58
7274:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7333:16:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"Yes, please cook lots more.

7333:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7405:15:11,266.66699981689453
I will eat it all."@g]

60
7405:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7523:10:11,266.66699981689453
Wujing kicked the pig. "Wake up!"

61
7523:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7655:51:51,266.66699981689453
Bajie jumped to his feet, wiping drool from the side of his mouth.

62
7655:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7785:13:31,266.66699981689453
"How dare you sleep while we wait for you?" said Wujing.

63
7785:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7898:45:11,266.66699981689453
"Now let's go back to Master."

64
7898:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7948:08:31,266.66699981689453
[g@The pig sighed.

65
7948:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8094:41:51,266.66699981689453
With his head hung low, he followed Wujing back to the road.@g]

66
8094:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8259:50:11,266.66699981689453
But when they got there, the Tang Monk was gone.

67
8259:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 8389:35:11,266.66699981689453
"Maybe he went for a walk," said Wujing.

68
8389:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 8542:38:31,266.66699981689453
He and Bajie wandered through the woods, looking for the monk.

69
8542:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8649:05:11,266.66699981689453
Soon they saw the pagoda.

70
8649:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 8796:58:31,266.66699981689453
They knocked on the door, and the monster answered.

71
8797:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8902:53:31,266.66699981689453
"Who are you?" asked the monster.

72
8902:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8986:26:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Wujing told the monster who they were.

73
8986:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 9051:41:51,266.66699981689453
"We're looking for a monk."@g]

9051:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 9098:15:11,266.66699981689453
The monster laughed.

75
9098:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 9180:13:31,266.66699981689453
