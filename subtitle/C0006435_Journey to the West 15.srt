[g@"I'm s-sorry," he said.

272:35:11,133.3329999446869 --> 331:50:11,133.3329999446869
"But . . . we're just monks.@g]

5
331:51:51,133.3329999446869 --> 386:20:11,133.3329999446869
We don't have any money."

6
386:21:51,133.3329999446869 --> 490:36:51,133.3329999446869
[g@"Then give us whatever else you have," said one robber.

7
490:38:31,133.3329999446869 --> 552:06:51,133.3329999446869
He came closer.@g]

552:08:31,133.3329999446869 --> 634:43:31,133.33300018310547
"Please, sir," said the monk. "We—"

634:45:11,133.33300018310547 --> 690:06:51,133.33300018310547
[g@Wukong put up his hand.

690:08:31,133.33300018310547 --> 768:20:11,133.33300018310547
"I'll deal with these robbers, Master."@g]

11
768:21:51,133.33300018310547 --> 831:40:11,133.33300018310547
[g@Wukong approached the men.

12
831:41:51,133.33300018310547 --> 954:18:31,133.33300018310547
They all laughed.@g]

954:20:11,133.33300018310547 --> 1058:00:11,133.33300018310547
"Look at the little monkey!" said one of them.

14
1058:01:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1129:53:31,133.33300018310547
[g@Wukong laughed too.

15
1129:55:11,133.33300018310547 --> 1187:18:31,133.33300018310547
"Yes, I am a monkey.@g]

16
1187:20:11,133.33300018310547 --> 1272:35:11,133.33300018310547
[g@And I am rather small, it's true."

17
1272:36:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1363:05:11,133.33300018310547
He removed the iron bar from his ear.@g]

18
1363:06:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1440:40:11,133.33300018310547
"But you should be scared of me anyway."

19
1440:41:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1624:05:11,133.33300018310547
His iron bar grew, and his eyes flashed red with anger.

20
1624:06:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1715:30:11,133.33300018310547
"The monkey is a spirit!" cried one man.

21
1715:31:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1803:58:31,133.33300018310547
"Run!" cried another.

22
1804:00:11,133.33300018310547 --> 1924:05:11,133.33300018310547
The robbers tripped over one another, trying to get away.

23
1924:06:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2034:18:31,133.33300018310547
Wukong raised the iron bar, ready to strike.

24
2034:20:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2102:18:31,133.33300018310547
[g@"Stop, Wukong!" cried the Tang Monk.

25
2102:20:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2144:20:11,133.33300018310547
"Don't hurt them!"@g]

26
2144:21:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2236:03:31,133.33300018310547
Wukong turned around as the men ran away.

27
2236:05:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2291:15:11,133.33300018310547
[g@"Why not?" he asked.

28
2291:16:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2351:08:31,133.33300018310547
"They were going to hurt us."@g]

29
2351:10:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2451:36:51,133.33300018310547
"A Buddhist monk never hurts people," said the monk.

30
2451:38:31,133.33300018310547 --> 2577:40:11,133.33300018310547
"I would rather get hurt than hurt someone else."

31
2577:41:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2683:43:31,133.33300018310547
[g@Wukong laughed. "That's ridiculous.

32
2683:45:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2735:13:31,133.33300018310547
We should have beaten them up!"@g]

33
2735:15:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2810:50:11,133.33300018310547
[g@The Tang Monk shook his head.

34
2810:51:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2882:00:11,133.33300018310547
"You are cruel and violent, Wukong."@g]

35
2882:01:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2929:35:11,133.33300018310547
[g@Wukong was angry.

36
2929:36:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3005:35:11,133.33300018310547
"I just saved your life!" he cried.@g]

37
3005:36:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3134:53:31,133.33300018310547
"How dare you scold me!" He paused.

38
3134:55:11,133.33300018310547 --> 3249:30:11,133.33300018310547
"I don't have to accept this treatment. I'm leaving!"

39
3249:31:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3452:30:11,133.33300018310547
Wukong leaped into the air and was gone.

40
3452:31:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3630:05:11,133.33300018310547
The Tang Monk sighed and then continued his journey.

41
3630:06:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3733:13:31,133.33300018310547
Later that day he saw an old woman.

42
3733:15:11,133.33300018310547 --> 3851:05:11,133.33300018310547
"Monk," said the woman. "Where are you going?"

43
3851:06:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3961:35:11,133.33300018310547
"I'm going to the Western Paradise," said the Tang Monk.

44
3961:36:51,133.33300018310547 --> 4067:03:31,133.33300018310547
"Don't you have anyone with you?" asked the woman.

45
4067:05:11,133.33300018310547 --> 4139:41:51,133.33300018310547
"You can't go there alone."

46
4139:43:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4231:08:31,133.33300018310547
"I did have a companion," said the Tang Monk.

47
4231:10:11,133.33300018310547 --> 4354:18:31,133.33300018310547
"But he got angry when I scolded him for being violent. He left."

48
4354:20:11,133.33300018310547 --> 4594:35:11,133.33300018310547
"Your companion will come back," said the woman.

49
4594:36:51,133.33300018310547 --> 4718:41:51,133.33300018310547
"When he does, trick him into putting this on."

50
4718:43:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4827:11:51,133.33300018310547
She pulled a metal headband out of her bag.

51
4827:13:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4994:23:31,133.33300018310547
"Whenever he misbehaves, recite the Tight Headband spell."

52
4994:25:11,133.33300018310547 --> 5148:28:31,133.33300018310547
The old woman whispered a magical spell to the Tang Monk.

53
5148:30:11,133.33300018310547 --> 5223:00:11,133.33300018310547
[g@"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

54
5223:01:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5311:06:51,133.33300018310547
"But how did you—"@g]

55
5311:08:31,133.33300018310547 --> 5483:45:11,133.33300018310547
There was a flash of bright light, and the woman rose into the air.

56
5483:46:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5572:48:31,133.33300018310547
"The bodhisattva Guanyin!" cried the Tang Monk.

57
5572:50:11,133.33300018310547 --> 5704:33:31,133.33300018310547
He got down from his horse and bowed.

58
5704:35:11,133.33300018310547 --> 5858:40:11,133.33300018310547
Meanwhile Wukong sat in the palace of the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea.

59
5858:41:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5969:00:11,133.33300018310547
He and the Dragon King were drinking tea.

60
5969:01:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6100:30:11,133.33300018310547
"I hope you've learned from your punishment," said the Dragon King.

61
6100:31:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6185:40:11,133.33300018310547
"Yes, I have," said Wukong.

62
6185:41:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6282:18:31,133.33300018310547
"I won't cause any more trouble for the Jade Emperor."

63
6282:20:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6367:13:31,133.33300018310547
[g@The Dragon King sipped his tea.

64
6367:15:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6437:01:51,133.33300018310547
"What will you do now?"@g]

65
6437:03:31,133.33300018310547 --> 6576:35:11,133.33300018310547
"I was traveling west with a monk, to get [n@scriptures from Buddha," said Wukong.

66
6576:36:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6640:00:11,133.33300018310547
"I promised Guanyin I would do it."

67
6640:01:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6754:15:11,133.33300018310547
The Dragon King smiled. "That's wonderful!"

68
6754:16:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6884:33:31,133.33300018310547
Wukong shrugged. "Yes, well, I'm not doing it anymore."

69
6884:35:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7017:20:11,133.33300018310547
The Dragon King put down his teacup. "Why not?"

70
7017:21:51,133.33300018310547 --> 7139:55:11,133.33300018310547
"That monk had a bad attitude," said Wukong.

71
7139:56:51,133.33300018310547 --> 7227:16:51,133.33300018310547
[g@"He yelled at me.

7374:10:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7500:33:31,133.33300018310547
[g@The Dragon King coughed nervously.

74
7500:35:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7606:10:11,133.33300018310547
"Well, Wukong. The monk has a point."@g]

75
7606:11:51,133.33300018310547 --> 7674:25:11,133.33300018310547
[g@Wukong glared at the king.

76
7674:26:51,133.33300018310547 --> 7731:23:31,133.33300018310547
"What do you mean?"@g]

77
7731:25:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7797:15:11,133.33300018310547
[g@The king hesitated and then said,

78
7797:16:51,133.33300018310547 --> 7881:28:31,133.33300018310547
"You [i@are@i] violent sometimes."@g]

7881:30:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7971:31:51,133.33300018310547
Wukong folded his arms and looked at the ground.

80
7971:33:31,133.33300018310547 --> 8046:10:11,133.33300018310547
The Dragon King continued.

81
8046:11:51,133.33300018310547 --> 8163:26:51,133.33300018310547
"Not only that, but you made a promise to Guanyin.

82
8163:28:31,133.33300018310547 --> 8437:30:11,133.33300018310547
Perhaps, Wukong, it is you who has a bad attitude?"
