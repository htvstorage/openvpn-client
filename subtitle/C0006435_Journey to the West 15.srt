1
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:16,043
The Tang Monk looked at the robbers.

2
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:17,926
He was shaking.

3
00:00:17,927 --> 00:00:20,945
"I'm s-sorry," he said.

4
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:23,079
"But . . . we're just monks.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,041
We don't have any money."

6
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:28,795
"Then give us whatever else you have," said one robber.

7
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:31,009
He came closer.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,983
"Please, sir," said the monk. "We—"

9
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:35,977
Wukong put up his hand.

10
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:38,793
"I'll deal with these robbers, Master."

11
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:41,073
Wukong approached the men.

12
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:45,488
They all laughed.

13
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:49,221
"Look at the little monkey!" said one of them.

14
00:00:49,222 --> 00:00:51,809
Wukong laughed too.

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,876
"Yes, I am a monkey.

16
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:56,946
And I am rather small, it's true."

17
00:00:56,947 --> 00:01:00,204
He removed the iron bar from his ear.

18
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:02,997
"But you should be scared of me anyway."

19
00:01:02,998 --> 00:01:09,600
His iron bar grew, and his eyes flashed red with anger.

20
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:12,891
"The monkey is a spirit!" cried one man.

21
00:01:12,892 --> 00:01:16,076
"Run!" cried another.

22
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:20,400
The robbers tripped over one another, trying to get away.

23
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:24,368
Wukong raised the iron bar, ready to strike.

24
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,816
"Stop, Wukong!" cried the Tang Monk.

25
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:28,329
"Don't hurt them!"

26
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,631
Wukong turned around as the men ran away.

27
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:33,618
"Why not?" he asked.

28
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:35,774
"They were going to hurt us."

29
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:39,391
"A Buddhist monk never hurts people," said the monk.

30
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:43,929
"I would rather get hurt than hurt someone else."

31
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,747
Wukong laughed. "That's ridiculous.

32
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:49,601
We should have beaten them up!"

33
00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:52,323
The Tang Monk shook his head.

34
00:01:52,324 --> 00:01:54,885
"You are cruel and violent, Wukong."

35
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:56,598
Wukong was angry.

36
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,334
"I just saved your life!" he cried.

37
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:03,989
"How dare you scold me!" He paused.

38
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,115
"I don't have to accept this treatment. I'm leaving!"

39
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:15,423
Wukong leaped into the air and was gone.

40
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,816
The Tang Monk sighed and then continued his journey.

41
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:25,529
Later that day he saw an old woman.

42
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,772
"Monk," said the woman. "Where are you going?"

43
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:33,750
"I'm going to the Western Paradise," said the Tang Monk.

44
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:37,547
"Don't you have anyone with you?" asked the woman.

45
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:40,162
"You can't go there alone."

46
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:43,454
"I did have a companion," said the Tang Monk.

47
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:47,888
"But he got angry when I scolded him for being violent. He left."

48
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:56,538
"Your companion will come back," said the woman.

49
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:01,006
"When he does, trick him into putting this on."

50
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:04,912
She pulled a metal headband out of her bag.

51
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:10,931
"Whenever he misbehaves, recite the Tight Headband spell."

52
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:16,478
The old woman whispered a magical spell to the Tang Monk.

53
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,161
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

54
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:22,333
"But how did you—"

55
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:28,548
There was a flash of bright light, and the woman rose into the air.

56
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,754
"The bodhisattva Guanyin!" cried the Tang Monk.

57
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:36,497
He got down from his horse and bowed.

58
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:42,045
Meanwhile Wukong sat in the palace of the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea.

59
00:03:42,046 --> 00:03:46,017
He and the Dragon King were drinking tea.

60
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:50,751
"I hope you've learned from your punishment," said the Dragon King.

61
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:53,817
"Yes, I have," said Wukong.

62
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,296
"I won't cause any more trouble for the Jade Emperor."

63
00:03:57,297 --> 00:04:00,353
The Dragon King sipped his tea.

64
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:02,866
"What will you do now?"

65
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:07,890
"I was traveling west with a monk, to get scriptures from Buddha," said Wukong.

66
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:10,173
"I promised Guanyin I would do it."

67
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:14,286
The Dragon King smiled. "That's wonderful!"

68
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:18,977
Wukong shrugged. "Yes, well, I'm not doing it anymore."

69
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:23,757
The Dragon King put down his teacup. "Why not?"

70
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:28,170
"That monk had a bad attitude," said Wukong.

71
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:31,315
"He yelled at me.

72
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:36,602
He said I was cruel and violent."

73
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:41,153
The Dragon King coughed nervously.

74
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:44,955
"Well, Wukong. The monk has a point."

75
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:47,412
Wukong glared at the king.

76
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,463
"What do you mean?"

77
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:51,834
The king hesitated and then said,

78
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:54,866
"You are violent sometimes."

79
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:58,108
Wukong folded his arms and looked at the ground.

80
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:00,795
The Dragon King continued.

81
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:05,017
"Not only that, but you made a promise to Guanyin.

82
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:14,883
Perhaps, Wukong, it is you who has a bad attitude?"
