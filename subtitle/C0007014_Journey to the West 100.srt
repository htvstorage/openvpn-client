1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:18,451
For over a month, the travelers stayed at Squire Kou's house.

2
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:25,995
Every time they tried to leave, the squire begged them to stay longer.

3
00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:32,163
Finally, one morning during breakfast, the Tang Monk insisted on leaving.

4
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:36,019
"We'll never fetch the True Scriptures if we stay here."

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,363
"Please don't leave," said Squire Kou.

6
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:41,745
"You are very important monks.

7
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:44,692
Having you as guests is a good deed."

8
00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:47,909
"I'd like to stay here," said Bajie.

9
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,770
He took a bite of a peach.

10
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:53,988
"No. Master's right," said Wukong.

11
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:56,615
"We must continue our journey."

12
00:00:56,616 --> 00:00:58,930
Lady Kou grew angry.

13
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:01,960
"You monks are ungrateful!

14
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,081
We have fed you and taken care of you.

15
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:07,832
Yet you can't wait to leave!"

16
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:11,578
"We are very grateful," said the Tang Monk.

17
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,532
"But we cannot stay any longer."

18
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:20,340
After breakfast Wujing got the horse from Squire Kou's stable.

19
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:22,490
Bajie gathered the bags.

20
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:32,193
The Tang Monk thanked Squire and Lady Kou, and the travelers headed west.

21
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:39,831
"They are ungrateful," muttered Lady Kou.

22
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:44,622
The next morning Lady Kou ran into the town's courthouse.

23
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:47,475
Tears filled her eyes.

24
00:01:47,476 --> 00:01:51,979
"I must speak with the judge!" she cried.

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,135
The judge rushed to her.

26
00:01:54,136 --> 00:01:56,903
"Lady Kou! What's wrong?"

27
00:01:56,904 --> 00:02:02,505
"Robbers broke into our house last night," said Lady Kou breathlessly.

28
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:06,954
"They stole many valuable items and two of our horses.

29
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:11,622
Squire Kou tried to stop them, but the robbers . . .

30
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:16,985
They . . . killed my husband!"

31
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:19,649
Lady Kou burst into tears.

32
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,440
The judge gasped.

33
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,843
"Oh no! Did you see the robbers?"

34
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,903
Lady Kou sniffed.

35
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:30,708
"Yes, and I know who they are."

36
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,235
"Who are they?" asked the judge.

37
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,646
Lady Kou gritted her teeth.

38
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:40,732
"The Tang Monk and his companions!"

39
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,252
The judge turned to a soldier.

40
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:50,639
"Gather some soldiers and arrest the Tang Monk and his companions!"

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,530
"I'm glad we're headed west again,"

42
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:56,312
said the Tang Monk as the travelers walked.

43
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:59,257
"I'm eager to reach the Western Paradise."

44
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:00,653
Wujing nodded.

45
00:03:00,654 --> 00:03:04,038
"We were delayed at Squire Kou's house for too long."

46
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,138
Bajie snorted.

47
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:09,271
"We should have stayed longer."

48
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:13,700
Suddenly a group of men stepped onto the road.

49
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:16,808
They carried swords and axes.

50
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:20,202
Their horses carried several large bundles.

51
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:25,230
"Give us your money!" shouted one man.

52
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:29,374
Wukong pulled out his iron bar.

53
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,162
"Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

54
00:03:32,163 --> 00:03:35,540
"Remember, you must not harm people."

55
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,276
Wukong smiled.

56
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:41,037
"I'm just going to talk to them, Master."

57
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:43,749
He turned to the man who had shouted.

58
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,248
"We have no money."

59
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,534
"No money, huh?" said the man.

60
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:53,499
"Well then, we're going to beat up all of you."

61
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,398
Wukong laughed.

62
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,921
"You don't realize who I am.

63
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:03,074
I'm Sun Wukong, the Monkey King!"

64
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:06,526
"I don't care who you are," said the man.

65
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:09,151
"We're dangerous robbers!

66
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:15,010
Last night we robbed a very wealthy squire."

67
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:19,506
The Tang Monk raised his eyebrows. "A squire?"

68
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:24,963
Wukong quickly recited a spell, which froze the robbers.

69
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:29,358
Wujing rushed to the horses and opened one of the bundles.

70
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:34,082
Inside were dishes, jewels, and other valuable items.

71
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,539
Wujing gasped.

72
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,257
"These items belong to Squire Kou!

73
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:41,499
So do the horses!"

74
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,673
The Tang Monk bit his lip.

75
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:46,004
"Squire Kou is a good man.

76
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:48,835
We must return his belongings."

77
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:51,477
Everyone agreed.

78
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:56,670
Wukong recited another spell, and the robbers became unfrozen.

79
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:01,188
The monkey grew large, and fire burned in his eyes.

80
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:04,352
"Get out of here!" he thundered.

81
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:08,085
"And never steal again!"

82
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:13,632
The robbers screamed and ran away.

83
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:17,898
The travelers headed back toward town with the squire's horses.

84
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:22,224
Soon they saw a group of soldiers on horseback.

85
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:25,704
"Those soldiers are riding toward us," said Wujing.

86
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:28,657
"I wonder what they want," said the Tang Monk.

87
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:32,697
One of the soldiers pointed a sword at the travelers.

88
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:41,294
"Stop, thieves! You're all under arrest!"
