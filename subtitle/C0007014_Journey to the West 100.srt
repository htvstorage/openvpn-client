208:51:50,933.3329999446869 --> 418:23:30,933.3329999446869
Every time they tried to leave, the squire begged them to stay longer.

3
418:25:10,933.3329999446869 --> 589:43:30,933.3329999446869
Finally, one morning during breakfast, the Tang Monk insisted on leaving.

4
589:45:10,933.3329999446869 --> 696:50:10,933.3330001831055
"We'll never fetch the True Scriptures if we stay here."

5
696:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 789:43:30,933.3330001831055
"Please don't leave," said Squire Kou.

6
789:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 855:53:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"You are very important monks.

7
855:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 937:45:10,933.3330001831055

1027:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1106:35:10,933.3330001831055
He took a bite of a peach.@g]

1106:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1195:58:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"No. Master's right," said Wukong.

11
1196:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1268:56:50,933.3330001831055
"We must continue our journey."@g]

12
1268:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1333:15:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Lady Kou grew angry.

13
1333:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1417:25:10,933.3330001831055
"You monks are ungrateful!@g]

14
1417:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1504:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@We have fed you and taken care of you.

1504:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1580:31:50,933.3330001831055
Yet you can't wait to leave!"@g]

1580:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1684:35:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"We are very grateful," said the Tang Monk.

1684:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1794:25:10,933.3330001831055
"But we cannot stay any longer."@g]

18
1794:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1927:58:30,933.3330001831055
After breakfast Wujing got the horse from Squire Kou's stable.

19
1928:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1987:41:50,933.3330001831055
Bajie gathered the bags.

20
1987:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2257:13:30,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk thanked Squire and Lady Kou, and the travelers headed west.

21
2257:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2469:23:30,933.3330001831055
"They are ungrateful," muttered Lady Kou.

22
2469:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2602:28:30,933.3330001831055
The next morning Lady Kou ran into the town's courthouse.

23
2602:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2681:43:30,933.3330001831055

2681:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2806:50:10,933.3330001831055
"I must speak with the judge!" she cried.@g]

2806:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2866:43:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The judge rushed to her.

2866:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2943:36:50,933.3330001831055
"Lady Kou! What's wrong?"@g]

27
2943:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3099:13:30,933.3330001831055
"Robbers broke into our house last night," said Lady Kou breathlessly.

28
3099:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3222:48:30,933.3330001831055
"They stole many valuable items and two of our horses.

3222:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3352:28:30,933.3330001831055
Squire Kou tried to stop them, but the robbers . . .

30
3352:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3501:26:50,933.3330001831055
[g@They . . . killed my husband!"

3501:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3575:26:50,933.3330001831055
Lady Kou burst into tears.@g]

3575:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3625:11:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The judge gasped.

3625:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3719:43:30,933.3330001831055
"Oh no! Did you see the robbers?"@g]

34
3719:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3776:56:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Lady Kou sniffed.

35
3776:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3882:38:30,933.3330001831055
"Yes, and I know who they are."@g]

36
3882:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3952:50:10,933.3330001831055
"Who are they?" asked the judge.

37
3952:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4019:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Lady Kou gritted her teeth.

38
4019:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4161:05:10,933.3330001831055
"The Tang Monk and his companions!"@g]

4161:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4231:05:10,933.3330001831055
The judge turned to a soldier.

40
4231:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4436:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Gather some soldiers and arrest the Tang Monk and his companions!"

41
4436:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4488:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"I'm glad we're headed west again,"

42
4488:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4593:51:50,933.3330001831055
said the Tang Monk [n@as the travelers walked.@g]

43
4593:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4675:40:10,933.3330001831055
"I'm eager to reach the Western Paradise."

44
4675:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4714:26:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wujing nodded.

45
4714:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4808:28:30,933.3330001831055
"We were delayed at Squire Kou's house for too long."@g]

46
4808:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4866:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie snorted.

47
4866:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4953:50:10,933.3330001831055
"We should have stayed longer."@g]

48
4953:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5076:51:50,933.3330001831055
Suddenly a group of men stepped onto the road.

49
5076:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5163:11:50,933.3330001831055
[g@They carried swords and axes.

50
5163:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5257:28:30,933.3330001831055
Their horses carried several large bundles.@g]

51
5257:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5397:08:30,933.3330001831055
"Give us your money!" shouted one man.

52
5397:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5512:15:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong pulled out his iron bar.

53
5512:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5589:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

54
5589:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5683:31:50,933.3330001831055
"Remember, you must not harm people."@g]

55
5683:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5731:45:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong smiled.

56
5731:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5836:13:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm just going to talk to them, Master."@g]

57
5836:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5911:33:30,933.3330001831055
[g@He turned to the man who had shouted.

5911:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5980:58:30,933.3330001831055
"We have no money."@g]

59
5981:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6072:15:10,933.3330001831055
"No money, huh?" said the man.

60
6072:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6182:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Well then, we're going to beat up all of you."

61
6182:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6262:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong laughed.

6262:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6333:00:10,933.3330001831055
"You don't realize who I am.

6333:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6448:21:50,933.3330001831055
[n@I'm Sun Wukong, the Monkey King!"@g]

6448:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6544:15:10,933.3330001831055
"I don't care who you are," said the man.

65
6544:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6617:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"We're dangerous robbers!

Last night we robbed a very wealthy squire."@g]

6779:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6904:48:30,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk raised his eyebrows. "A squire?"

68
6904:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7056:23:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong quickly recited a spell, which froze the robbers.

69
7056:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7178:28:30,933.3330001831055
Wujing rushed to the horses and opened one of the bundles.

70
7178:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7309:41:50,933.3330001831055
Inside were dishes, jewels, and other valuable items.

71
7309:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7377:56:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wujing gasped.

7377:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7453:26:50,933.3330001831055
"These items belong to Squire Kou!

7453:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7515:43:30,933.3330001831055

7515:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7576:06:50,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk bit his lip.

75
7576:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7640:51:50,933.3330001831055

7792:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7937:08:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong recited another spell, [n@and the robbers became unfrozen.@g]

79
7937:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8062:38:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey grew large, and fire burned in his eyes.

80
8062:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8150:31:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Get out of here!" he thundered.

8254:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8408:18:30,933.3330001831055
The robbers screamed and ran away.

83
8408:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8526:48:30,933.3330001831055
The travelers headed back toward town with the squire's horses.

8526:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8646:58:30,933.3330001831055
Soon they saw a group of soldiers on horseback.

85
8647:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8743:38:30,933.3330001831055
"Those soldiers are riding toward us," said Wujing.

86
8743:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8825:40:10,933.3330001831055
"I wonder what they want," said the Tang Monk.

87
8825:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8937:53:30,933.3330001831055
One of the soldiers pointed a sword at the travelers.

88
8937:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 9176:41:50,933.3330001831055
"Stop, thieves! You're all under arrest!"
