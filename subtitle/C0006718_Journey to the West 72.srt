1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:18,841
Wukong went straight to Mount Potalaka.

2
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:24,487
The bodhisattva Guanyin was in her garden.

3
00:00:24,488 --> 00:00:28,707
"Hello, Wukong. How is the journey going?"

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,840
[g@Wukong threw up his hands.

5
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,245
"The Tang Monk is crazy!"@g]

6
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:36,302
"Why?" asked the bodhisattva.

7
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:40,082
"He told me to leave," said the monkey.

8
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,535
"He was mad because I was going to hurt some robbers."

9
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:47,459
[g@Guanyin frowned. "It's wrong to hurt people, Wukong.

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,609
You know that."@g]

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,171
"I hurt demons all the time," said Wukong.

12
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:57,006
"That's different," said Guanyin.

13
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:01,995
"Demons are evil, and you're doing a good thing when you get rid of them.

14
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:06,186
But you must not hurt people."

15
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:10,070
The monkey sat down and put his head in his hands.

16
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:13,131
[g@"Oh, Bodhisattva, you're right."

17
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:15,358
He started to cry.@g]

18
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,018
"This is terrible.

19
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:21,514
Now I'll never reach the Western Paradise with the Tang Monk.

20
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,796
I wanted to earn forgiveness."

21
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:28,137
"Don't cry, Wukong," said Guanyin.

22
00:01:28,138 --> 00:01:32,578
"You will still help the Tang Monk reach the Western Paradise.

23
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,895
[g@He will need your help soon.

24
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:43,942
In the meantime you may stay here with me."@g]

25
00:01:43,943 --> 00:01:47,822
[g@Bajie dropped the bags.

26
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:52,827
"Let's rest here," he said. "I'm starving."@g]

27
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:58,954
The Tang Monk climbed down from his horse and stretched.

28
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:03,547
The horse drank from a stream while Bajie looked in a bag.

29
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:06,909
"We're out of rice," said the pig.

30
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,357
"We'll have to beg for food somewhere," said Wujing.

31
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:11,973
He looked at the monk.

32
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:16,786
"Master, you wait here while Bajie and I find a village."

33
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:21,193
The monk's two companions flew off.

34
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:26,347
The monk sat down in the grass next to the road and closed his eyes.

35
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:29,925
He had nearly dozed off when he heard a voice.

36
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:36,495
"Master!" It was Wukong.

37
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:39,687
[g@The Tang Monk glared at the monkey.

38
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:41,972
"Why are you here, Wukong?"@g]

39
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:44,366
The monkey fell to his knees.

40
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:48,448
"I'm begging youâ€”please let me join you again."

41
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:52,489
"No," said the monk. "You're evil, Wukong.

42
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,378
You can't go to the Western Paradise with me.

43
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:00,024
Now leave before I recite the Tight Headband spell!"

44
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:03,670
[g@The monkey was furious.

45
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:07,048
He pulled out his iron bar, which quickly grew.@g]

46
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:13,243
Before the monk could recite the spell, Wukong struck. [i@Whap!@i]

47
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:15,377
He knocked out the monk.

48
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:20,364
Quickly, the monkey grabbed the bags and then vanished.

49
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:23,466
Wujing and Bajie soon returned.

50
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:28,775
They found the Tang Monk sitting by the road, rubbing his head.

51
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:32,475
"Master!" cried Wujing. "What happened?"

52
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:36,766
"Where are the bags?" asked Bajie, looking around.

53
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:39,835
"Wukong returned," said the Tang Monk.

54
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:42,200
"He begged me to let him join us again.

55
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:45,216
I said no, and then he attacked me!"

56
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:48,789
"That's terrible!" said Wujing.

57
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,828
[g@"That rotten monkey!"

58
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,106
Bajie stomped his foot.@g]

59
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,389
"We can't let him get away with this!

60
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,885
He probably went home, to the Fruit and Flower Mountain."

61
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:02,622
"I'll go there and deal with him," said Wujing.

62
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:11,131
Bajie gave Wujing directions to the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

63
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:17,994
When Wujing arrived there, he found Wukong near the waterfall.

64
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:23,008
"Wukong!" shouted Wujing. "Why did you attack Master?"

65
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,980
[g@The monkey looked at Wujing blankly.

66
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:29,383
"Who are you?"@g]

67
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:31,593
Wujing raised an eyebrow.

68
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:33,393
[g@"What are you talking about?

69
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:35,780
You know who I am."@g]

70
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:39,350
"No, I don't," said Wukong.

71
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:41,296
[g@"I'm Sha Wujing!

72
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:44,233
We were traveling to the West together."@g]

73
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:48,506
"I'm going to the West but not with you," said Wukong.

74
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:50,569
[g@He pointed to a group of figures.

75
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,531
"I'm going with them."@g]

76
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:54,402
Wujing looked over.

77
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:59,060
A monk who looked exactly like the Tang Monk sat on a horse.

78
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:02,095
A pig stood next to the horse.

79
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:04,420
"Bajie?" said Wujing.

80
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:11,749
Just then he saw a purple figure walk over to the horse.

81
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:19,979
Wujing gasped in shock. "That's me!"
