Wukong went straight to Mount Potalaka.

2
219:41:50,933.3329999446869 --> 376:30:10,933.3329999446869
The bodhisattva Guanyin was in her garden.

376:31:50,933.3329999446869 --> 493:43:30,933.3329999446869
"Hello, Wukong. How is the journey going?"

4
493:45:10,933.3329999446869 --> 552:58:30,933.3329999446869
[g@Wukong threw up his hands.

5
553:00:10,933.3329999446869 --> 619:46:50,933.3330001831055
"The Tang Monk is crazy!"@g]

6
619:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 704:41:50,933.3330001831055
"Why?" asked the bodhisattva.

7
704:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 809:41:50,933.3330001831055
"He told me to leave," said the monkey.

8
809:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 905:36:50,933.3330001831055
"He was mad because I was going to hurt some robbers."

9
905:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1014:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Guanyin frowned. "It's wrong to hurt people, Wukong.

10
1014:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1074:20:10,933.3330001831055
You know that."@g]

1074:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1201:03:30,933.3330001831055
"I hurt demons all the time," said Wukong.

12
1201:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1279:48:30,933.3330001831055
"That's different," said Guanyin.

13
1279:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1418:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Demons are evil, and you're doing a good thing when you get rid of them.

14
1418:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1534:48:30,933.3330001831055
But you must not hurt people."

15
1534:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1642:41:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey sat down and put his head in his hands.

16
1642:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1727:43:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Oh, Bodhisattva, you're right."

17
1727:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1789:35:10,933.3330001831055
He started to cry.@g]

18
1789:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1835:41:50,933.3330001831055
"This is terrible.

1835:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1960:35:10,933.3330001831055
Now I'll never reach the Western Paradise with the Tang Monk.

20
1960:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2051:45:10,933.3330001831055
I wanted to earn forgiveness."

2051:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2144:33:30,933.3330001831055
"Don't cry, Wukong," said Guanyin.

2144:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2267:55:10,933.3330001831055

2583:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2691:21:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie dropped the bags.

26
2691:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2830:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Let's rest here," he said. "I'm starving."@g]

27
2830:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3000:35:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk climbed down from his horse and stretched.

28
3000:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3128:10:10,933.3330001831055
The horse drank from a stream while Bajie looked in a bag.

29
3128:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3221:33:30,933.3330001831055
"We're out of rice," said the pig.

30
3221:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3317:20:10,933.3330001831055
"We'll have to beg for food somewhere," said Wujing.

31
3317:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3362:13:30,933.3330001831055
He looked at the monk.

32
3362:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3495:55:10,933.3330001831055
"Master, you wait here while Bajie and I find a village."

33
3495:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3618:20:10,933.3330001831055
The monk's two companions flew off.

34
3618:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3761:30:10,933.3330001831055
The monk sat down in the grass next to the road and closed his eyes.

35
3761:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3860:53:30,933.3330001831055
He had nearly dozed off when he heard a voice.

36
3860:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4043:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Master!" It was Wukong.

4195:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4262:01:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey fell to his knees.

4262:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4375:25:10,933.3330001831055

4375:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4487:40:10,933.3330001831055
"No," said the monk. "You're evil, Wukong.

4487:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4567:55:10,933.3330001831055

4798:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4892:05:10,933.3330001831055

4892:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5064:10:10,933.3330001831055
Before the monk could recite the spell, Wukong struck. [i@Whap!@i]

5064:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5123:26:50,933.3330001831055
He knocked out the monk.

48
5123:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5261:58:30,933.3330001831055
Quickly, the monkey grabbed the bags and then vanished.

5262:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5348:08:30,933.3330001831055
Wujing and Bajie soon returned.

5348:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5495:36:50,933.3330001831055
They found the Tang Monk sitting by the road, rubbing his head.

51
5495:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5598:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Master!" cried Wujing. "What happened?"

5598:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5717:35:10,933.3330001831055
"Where are the bags?" asked Bajie, looking around.

5717:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5802:50:10,933.3330001831055

5952:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6051:33:30,933.3330001831055

He probably went home, to the Fruit and Flower Mountain."

6435:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6672:10:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie gave Wujing directions to the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

6672:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6862:48:30,933.3330001831055
When Wujing arrived there, he found Wukong near the waterfall.

6862:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7002:05:10,933.3330001831055

7874:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8003:31:50,933.3330001831055
A monk who looked exactly like the Tang Monk sat on a horse.

8003:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8087:50:10,933.3330001831055
A pig stood next to the horse.

8152:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8356:00:10,933.3330001831055
Just then he saw a purple figure walk over to the horse.

81
8356:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8584:36:50,933.3330001831055
Wujing gasped in shock. "That's me!"
