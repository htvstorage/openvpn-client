1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:17,518
The Tang Monk and Wujing were tied up inside the demons' cave.

2
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,880
Bajie was also tied up, floating in the tub of salt water again.

3
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:26,150
The three demons talked in another room.

4
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:31,402
"That pig will taste wonderful once he's pickled," said the elephant.

5
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:33,935
"I agree," said the lion.

6
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:36,938
"But the main course is the Tang Monk.

7
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:40,342
It will be nice to live forever."

8
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:41,659
The elephant nodded.

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,030
"Let's fry the monk with garlic and spices.

10
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:47,782
I'll go see what we have in the kitchen."

11
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:50,789
"Wait a minute," said the raptor.

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,399
"We need a plan.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,493
Wukong will certainly try to rescue his friends."

14
00:00:56,494 --> 00:00:58,864
"You're right," said the lion.

15
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:01,394
He felt his broken tooth.

16
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,480
"I don't want that to happen."

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,858
The elephant looked at his bruised trunk.

18
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,925
"Me neither."

19
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:12,930
"Well, this time I have a plan," said the raptor.

20
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,771
"We'll start a rumor.

21
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:20,456
We'll tell every demon nearby that we've already eaten the Tang Monk.

22
00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:25,559
When Wukong hears that, he'll give up hope and leave the area."

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,312
"Brilliant!" said the lion.

24
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:29,868
The elephant smiled.

25
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:34,606
"It's the perfect plan."

26
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:39,494
Wukong sat next to the road, thinking about what to do.

27
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:43,952
"Those demons keep tricking me," the monkey said to himself.

28
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:45,612
"Well, no more!

29
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:48,647
I'll go into that cave and rescue my friends.

30
00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:53,627
When the demons attack, I'll clobber them with my iron bar.

31
00:01:53,628 --> 00:01:58,112
Even if they cry and promise not to hurt us, I won't believe them."

32
00:01:58,113 --> 00:02:00,150
The monkey stood up.

33
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,896
He saw two fiends coming down the road.

34
00:02:03,897 --> 00:02:07,639
"I wonder who they are," thought the monkey.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,499
He hid behind a rock and waited for the fiends to pass by.

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,671
"Those demons are lucky," said one fiend.

37
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:19,087
"Yep," said the other.

38
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:25,731
"They ate the Tang Monk, and now they'll live forever," said the first fiend.

39
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:27,709
He sighed.

40
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,874
"It would be nice to live forever."

41
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,374
"Yep," said the other fiend.

42
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:38,511
The two fiends continued along the road.

43
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:40,492
Wukong was heartbroken.

44
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,127
Tears poured from his eyes.

45
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:45,452
"I failed you, Master!

46
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:52,371
I couldn't protect you, and now you'll never reach the Western Paradise!"

47
00:02:52,372 --> 00:03:00,273
Wukong buried his head in his hands and cried for a long time.

48
00:03:00,274 --> 00:03:05,465
Finally he stood up and wiped away the tears.

49
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,730
"I know what I must do."

50
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:14,266
The monkey leaped into the air and headed west.

51
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:19,963
He arrived at the Thunderclap Monastery, and a guard let him enter.

52
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:23,304
Wukong went before Buddha and bowed.

53
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:26,552
"Forgive me, Buddha, but I have failed.

54
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:34,084
Earlier today, the Tang Monk, he was . . . he was . . ."

55
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:37,535
The monkey burst into tears again.

56
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:39,033
Buddha smiled.

57
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:41,719
"Please don't cry, Wukong.

58
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,953
The Tang Monk is fine.

59
00:03:43,954 --> 00:03:46,804
The demons haven't eaten him."

60
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:48,559
Wukong looked up.

61
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,628
"Are you sure?" he asked hopefully.

62
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:53,723
"Yes," said Buddha.

63
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:57,151
"I can see everything in the universe.

64
00:03:57,152 --> 00:04:01,909
I know exactly who those demons are and what they did.

65
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,846
They tricked you into thinking they'd eaten the Tang Monk.

66
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:09,900
They wanted you to give up hope."

67
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:13,274
"What?" Wukong shouted in anger.

68
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:15,121
"Those rotten demons!

69
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:20,925
They tricked me again!"

70
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:24,889
Wukong swung his iron bar at the cave entrance.

71
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:30,973
Smash! The entrance exploded, and the three demons ran outside.

72
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:34,824
The lion demon shouted, "How dare youâ€”"

73
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:40,419
Suddenly he looked up and saw an enormous figure. "Buddha!"

74
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,817
The lion and the elephant trembled with fear.

75
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:49,429
Light flashed as Buddha turned the two demons into ordinary animals.

76
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,762
Only the raptor demon wasn't scared.

77
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:57,145
His eyes burning with fury, the bird shot toward Buddha.

78
00:04:57,146 --> 00:05:04,392
But Buddha raised a finger, and the bird was paralyzed in midair.

79
00:05:04,393 --> 00:05:06,353
Buddha looked at Wukong.

80
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:09,661
"You may free your companions now.

81
00:05:09,662 --> 00:05:15,117
I will see you when you reach the Western Paradise."

82
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:16,568
Wukong bowed.

83
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,732
"Thank you, Buddha."
