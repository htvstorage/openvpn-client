00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 182:55:10,933.3329999446869
The Tang Monk and Wujing were tied up inside the demons' cave.

2
182:56:50,933.3329999446869 --> 331:51:50,933.3329999446869
Bajie was also tied up, floating in the tub of salt water again.

3
331:53:30,933.3329999446869 --> 422:41:50,933.3329999446869
The three demons talked in another room.

4
422:43:30,933.3329999446869 --> 568:35:10,933.3329999446869
"That pig will taste wonderful once he's pickled," said the elephant.

5
568:36:50,933.3329999446869 --> 638:56:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"I agree," said the lion.

6
638:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 722:21:50,933.3330001831055
"But the main course is the Tang Monk.@g]

7
722:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 816:55:10,933.3330001831055
It will be nice to live forever."

8
816:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 853:30:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The elephant nodded.

9
853:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 947:08:30,933.3330001831055
"Let's fry the monk with garlic and spices.@g]

10
947:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1023:35:10,933.3330001831055
I'll go see what we have in the kitchen."

11
1023:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1107:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Wait a minute," said the raptor.

12
1107:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1151:50:10,933.3330001831055
"We need a plan.@g]

13
1151:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1265:33:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong will certainly try to rescue his friends."

14
1265:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1331:25:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"You're right," said the lion.

15
1331:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1401:41:50,933.3330001831055
He felt his broken tooth.@g]

16
1401:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1487:25:10,933.3330001831055
"I don't want that to happen."

17
1487:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1553:28:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The elephant looked at his bruised trunk.

18
1553:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1610:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Me neither."@g]

19
1610:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1722:08:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Well, this time I have a plan," said the raptor.

20
1722:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1773:16:50,933.3330001831055
"We'll start a rumor.@g]

21
1773:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1931:11:50,933.3330001831055
We'll tell every demon nearby that we've already eaten the Tang Monk.

22
1931:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2072:56:50,933.3330001831055
When Wukong hears that, he'll give up hope and leave the area."

23
2072:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2149:25:10,933.3330001831055
"Brilliant!" said the lion.

24
2149:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2192:38:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The elephant smiled.

25
2192:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2324:15:10,933.3330001831055
"It's the perfect plan."@g]

26
2324:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2460:01:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong sat next to the road, thinking about what to do.

27
2460:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2583:51:50,933.3330001831055
"Those demons keep tricking me," the monkey said to himself.

28
2583:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2629:58:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Well, no more!

29
2630:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2714:16:50,933.3330001831055
I'll go into that cave and rescue my friends.@g]

30
2714:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2852:36:50,933.3330001831055
When the demons attack, I'll clobber them with my iron bar.

31
2852:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2977:11:50,933.3330001831055
Even if they cry and promise not to hurt us, I won't believe them."

32
2977:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3033:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The monkey stood up.

33
3033:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3137:51:50,933.3330001831055
He saw two fiends coming down the road.@g]

34
3137:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3241:50:10,933.3330001831055
"I wonder who they are," thought the monkey.

35
3241:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3376:50:10,933.3330001831055
He hid behind a rock and waited for the fiends to pass by.

36
3376:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3492:43:30,933.3330001831055
"Those demons are lucky," said one fiend.

37
3492:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3559:50:10,933.3330001831055
"Yep," said the other.

38
3559:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3744:23:30,933.3330001831055
"They ate the Tang Monk, and now they'll live forever," said the first fiend.

39
3744:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3799:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@He sighed.

40
3799:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3887:15:10,933.3330001831055
"It would be nice to live forever."@g]

41
3887:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3984:28:30,933.3330001831055
"Yep," said the other fiend.

42
3984:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4099:23:30,933.3330001831055
The two fiends continued along the road.

43
4099:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4154:25:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong was heartbroken.

44
4154:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4227:36:50,933.3330001831055
Tears poured from his eyes.@g]

45
4227:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4292:11:50,933.3330001831055
"I failed you, Master!

46
4292:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4484:23:30,933.3330001831055
I couldn't protect you, and now you'll never reach the Western Paradise!"

47
4484:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4703:53:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong buried his head in his hands and cried for a long time.

48
4703:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4848:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Finally he stood up and wiped away the tears.

49
4848:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4911:01:50,933.3330001831055
"I know what I must do."@g]

50
4911:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5092:35:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey leaped into the air and headed west.

51
5092:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5250:50:10,933.3330001831055
He arrived at the Thunderclap Monastery, and a guard let him enter.

52
5250:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5343:38:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong went before Buddha and bowed.

53
5343:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5433:51:50,933.3330001831055
"Forgive me, Buddha, but I have failed.

54
5433:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5643:05:10,933.3330001831055
Earlier today, the Tang Monk, he was . . . he was . . ."

55
5643:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5738:56:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey burst into tears again.

56
5738:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5780:33:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Buddha smiled.

57
5780:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5855:10:10,933.3330001831055
"Please don't cry, Wukong.@g]

5855:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5917:13:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk is fine.

59
5917:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5996:25:10,933.3330001831055
The demons haven't eaten him."@g]

5996:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6045:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong looked up.

61
6045:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6130:25:10,933.3330001831055
"Are you sure?" he asked hopefully.@g]

62
6130:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6188:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Yes," said Buddha.

63
6188:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6283:50:10,933.3330001831055
"I can see everything in the universe.@g]

6283:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6416:00:10,933.3330001831055
I know exactly who those demons are and what they did.

65
6416:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6525:21:50,933.3330001831055
They tricked you into thinking they'd eaten the Tang Monk.

66
6525:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6637:58:30,933.3330001831055
They wanted you to give up hope."

67
6638:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6731:41:50,933.3330001831055
"What?" Wukong shouted in anger.

68
6731:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6783:00:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Those rotten demons!

6783:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6944:13:30,933.3330001831055
They tricked me again!"@g]

70
6944:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7054:20:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong swung his iron bar at the cave entrance.

71
7054:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7223:20:10,933.3330001831055
[i@Smash!@i] The entrance exploded, and the three demons ran outside.

72
7223:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7330:18:30,933.3330001831055
The lion demon shouted, "How dare youâ€”"

73
7330:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7485:43:30,933.3330001831055
Suddenly he looked up and saw an enormous figure. "Buddha!"

74
7485:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7580:06:50,933.3330001831055
The lion and the elephant trembled with fear.

75
7580:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7736:00:10,933.3330001831055
Light flashed as Buddha turned the two demons into ordinary animals.

76
7736:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7828:35:10,933.3330001831055
Only the raptor demon wasn't scared.

77
7828:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7950:20:10,933.3330001831055
His eyes burning with fury, the bird shot toward Buddha.

78
7950:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8151:38:30,933.3330001831055
But Buddha raised a finger, and the bird was paralyzed in midair.

79
8151:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8206:06:50,933.3330001831055
