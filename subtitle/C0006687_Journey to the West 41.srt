1
00:00:11,000 --> 147:15:11,000
Wukong was angry at the guard at the southern gate of Heaven.

2
147:16:51,000 --> 237:21:51,000
"Why can't you close the gate and dim the stars?"

3
237:23:31,000 --> 288:38:31,000
The guard looked nervous.

4
288:40:11,000 --> 440:01:51,000
"I can do that only if I have permission from the Jade Emperor."

5
440:03:31,000 --> 540:26:51,000
"I'm trying to save the Tang Monk!" cried Wukong.

6
540:28:31,000 --> 628:58:31,000
"A demon is planning to eat him."

7
629:00:11,000 --> 694:03:31,000
[g@"I'm sorry," said the guard.

8
694:05:11,000 --> 765:38:31,000
"But I can't help you."@g]

9
765:40:11,000 --> 861:25:11,000
Wukong's eyes became dark and angry.

10
861:26:51,000 --> 1049:10:11,000
He pulled the iron bar out of his ear.

11
1049:11:51,000 --> 1168:35:11,000
A messenger ran into the Cloud Palace and bowed.

12
1168:36:51,000 --> 1264:41:51,000
"Sun Wukong is at the southern gate of Heaven, Your Majesty.

13
1264:43:31,000 --> 1372:25:11,000
He's going to destroy Heaven if we don't do what he says."

14
1372:26:51,000 --> 1459:53:31,000
The Jade Emperor slammed his fist down.

15
1459:55:11,000 --> 1498:15:11,000
[g@"That rotten monkey!

16
1498:16:51,000 --> 1545:03:31,000
What does he want?"@g]

17
1545:05:11,000 --> 1711:05:11,000
"He wants us to close the gate and dim the stars," said the messenger.

18
1711:06:51,000 --> 1779:28:31,000
"Why?" asked the emperor.

19
1779:30:11,000 --> 1912:21:51,000
"He wants to pretend Heaven got sucked into a gourd," said the messenger.

20
1912:23:31,000 --> 1994:38:31,000
[g@The Jade Emperor looked confused.

21
1994:40:11,000 --> 2059:10:11,000
"Why does he want to do that?"@g]

22
2059:11:51,000 --> 2126:10:11,000
"He didn't say," said the messenger.

23
2126:11:51,000 --> 2239:01:51,000
"He just said he's trying to save the Tang Monk."

24
2239:03:31,000 --> 2303:18:31,000
The Jade Emperor sighed.

25
2303:20:11,000 --> 2405:36:51,000
"You have my permission to close the gate and dim the stars.

26
2405:38:31,000 --> 2547:25:11,000
I don't want any more trouble from that monkey."

27
2547:26:51,000 --> 2623:31:51,000
The messenger returned to the gate.

28
2623:33:31,000 --> 2726:08:31,000
"We will close the gate and dim the stars," he said.

29
2726:10:11,000 --> 2786:33:31,000
[g@"Good," said Wukong.

30
2786:35:11,000 --> 2866:53:31,000
He put the iron bar back in his ear.@g]

31
2866:55:11,000 --> 3065:46:51,000
"Wait until I say 'Heaven.'"

32
3065:48:31,000 --> 3215:13:31,000
Wukong returned to his body, which was still in disguise as a demon.

33
3215:15:11,000 --> 3327:28:31,000
"Now I will call to Heaven," said the monkey to the demon.

34
3327:30:11,000 --> 3414:41:51,000
"The whole place will get sucked into this gourd."

35
3414:43:31,000 --> 3548:20:11,000
He held up the gourd. "Heaven!"

36
3548:21:51,000 --> 3644:41:51,000
Right away the sky went dark.

37
3644:43:31,000 --> 3739:48:31,000
[g@"Amazing!" cried the demon.

38
3739:50:11,000 --> 3844:33:31,000
"All of Heaven is now in that gourd?"@g]

39
3844:35:11,000 --> 3912:33:31,000
"Yes," said Wukong.

40
3912:35:11,000 --> 4035:05:11,000
"All the stars, planets, spirits, and gods are in here.

41
4035:06:51,000 --> 4173:53:31,000
Even the Cloud Palace is in here, with the Jade Emperor too!

42
4173:55:11,000 --> 4251:28:31,000
[g@Now I will let Heaven back out."

43
4251:30:11,000 --> 4370:36:51,000
He held up the gourd. "Heaven, return!"@g]

44
4370:38:31,000 --> 4441:15:11,000
The sky lit up again.

45
4441:16:51,000 --> 4535:46:51,000
[g@"Fascinating!" said the demon.

46
4535:48:31,000 --> 4657:41:51,000
"Let's trade gourds!"@g]

47
4657:43:31,000 --> 4734:15:11,000
He handed his gourd to Wukong.

48
4734:16:51,000 --> 4837:31:51,000
Wukong gave the fake gourd to the demon.

49
4837:33:31,000 --> 5044:58:31,000
Then he made the real gourd tiny and hid it in his robe.

50
5045:00:11,000 --> 5188:31:51,000
"I'll try to capture Heaven now," said the demon.

51
5188:33:31,000 --> 5310:51:51,000
He held up the gourd. "Heaven!"

52
5310:53:31,000 --> 5370:40:11,000
Nothing happened.

53
5370:41:51,000 --> 5517:06:51,000
"Heaven!" said the demon again. "Heaven! Heaven!"

54
5517:08:31,000 --> 5602:43:31,000
He looked at the gourd.

55
5602:45:11,000 --> 5690:01:51,000
[g@"This gourd isn't working.

56
5690:03:31,000 --> 5793:55:11,000
What's wrong with it?"@g]

57
5793:56:51,000 --> 5909:51:51,000
Wukong laughed and made the fake gourd disappear.

58
5909:53:31,000 --> 5995:18:31,000
Then he made himself invisible.

59
5995:20:11,000 --> 6086:23:31,000
[g@"I was tricked!" cried the demon.

60
6086:25:11,000 --> 6203:25:11,000
"I must tell Golden Horn."@g]

61
6203:26:51,000 --> 6315:01:51,000
The demon ran off, and Wukong followed.

62
6315:03:31,000 --> 6491:55:11,000
[g@Soon the road went up a mountain.

63
6491:56:51,000 --> 6557:05:11,000
The demon ran into a cave.@g]

64
6557:06:51,000 --> 6745:46:51,000
Wukong made himself visible and stormed into the cave.

65
6745:48:31,000 --> 6880:46:51,000
Looking around at the group of demons, he pulled out his iron bar.

66
6880:48:31,000 --> 6974:01:51,000
[g@"Return my friends at once!" he shouted.

67
6974:03:31,000 --> 7065:15:11,000
"Or I'll clobber all of you!"@g]

68
7065:16:51,000 --> 7163:46:51,000
"Ahh!" cried the small demons.

69
7163:48:31,000 --> 7336:36:51,000
They ran in every direction, tripping over one another.

70
7336:38:31,000 --> 7430:31:51,000
Wukong swung his iron bar at Golden Horn.

71
7430:33:31,000 --> 7559:28:31,000
The demon stepped out of the way and pulled a golden rope from his sleeve.

72
7559:30:11,000 --> 7680:53:31,000
He swung the rope, and it shot toward Wukong.

73
7680:55:11,000 --> 7798:21:51,000
The monkey tried to get out of the way, but the rope snagged him.

74
7798:23:31,000 --> 7869:25:11,000
It looped around his waist.

75
7869:26:51,000 --> 8043:11:51,000
The more Wukong tried to wriggle free, the tighter the rope got.

76
8043:13:31,000 --> 8123:43:31,000
[g@Golden Horn laughed.

77
8123:45:11,000 --> 8227:11:51,000
"You'll never escape the golden rope.@g]

78
8227:13:31,000 --> 8473:55:11,000
Tonight I will dine on the Tang Monk!"
