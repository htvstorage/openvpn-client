1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,301
Wukong was angry at the guard at the southern gate of Heaven.

2
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:19,545
"Why can't you close the gate and dim the stars?"

3
00:00:19,546 --> 00:00:21,391
The guard looked nervous.

4
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:26,841
"I can do that only if I have permission from the Jade Emperor."

5
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:30,456
"I'm trying to save the Tang Monk!" cried Wukong.

6
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:33,643
"A demon is planning to eat him."

7
00:00:33,644 --> 00:00:35,986
"I'm sorry," said the guard.

8
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:38,563
"But I can't help you."

9
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:42,011
Wukong's eyes became dark and angry.

10
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:48,770
He pulled the iron bar out of his ear.

11
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:53,069
A messenger ran into the Cloud Palace and bowed.

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,529
"Sun Wukong is at the southern gate of Heaven, Your Majesty.

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,407
He's going to destroy Heaven if we don't do what he says."

14
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:03,556
The Jade Emperor slammed his fist down.

15
00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:04,937
"That rotten monkey!

16
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:06,622
What does he want?"

17
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:12,599
"He wants us to close the gate and dim the stars," said the messenger.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,061
"Why?" asked the emperor.

19
00:01:15,062 --> 00:01:19,845
"He wants to pretend Heaven got sucked into a gourd," said the messenger.

20
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,807
The Jade Emperor looked confused.

21
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:25,130
"Why does he want to do that?"

22
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:27,542
"He didn't say," said the messenger.

23
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:31,605
"He just said he's trying to save the Tang Monk."

24
00:01:31,606 --> 00:01:33,919
The Jade Emperor sighed.

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,602
"You have my permission to close the gate and dim the stars.

26
00:01:37,603 --> 00:01:42,707
I don't want any more trouble from that monkey."

27
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,447
The messenger returned to the gate.

28
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:49,141
"We will close the gate and dim the stars," he said.

29
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,316
"Good," said Wukong.

30
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:54,208
He put the iron bar back in his ear.

31
00:01:54,209 --> 00:02:01,368
"Wait until I say 'Heaven.'"

32
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:06,748
Wukong returned to his body, which was still in disguise as a demon.

33
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:10,789
"Now I will call to Heaven," said the monkey to the demon.

34
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,929
"The whole place will get sucked into this gourd."

35
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,740
He held up the gourd. "Heaven!"

36
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:22,209
Right away the sky went dark.

37
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,633
"Amazing!" cried the demon.

38
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:29,404
"All of Heaven is now in that gourd?"

39
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:31,852
"Yes," said Wukong.

40
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:36,263
"All the stars, planets, spirits, and gods are in here.

41
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:41,260
Even the Cloud Palace is in here, with the Jade Emperor too!

42
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,053
Now I will let Heaven back out."

43
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:48,342
He held up the gourd. "Heaven, return!"

44
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:50,885
The sky lit up again.

45
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:54,288
"Fascinating!" said the demon.

46
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:58,677
"Let's trade gourds!"

47
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,433
He handed his gourd to Wukong.

48
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:05,151
Wukong gave the fake gourd to the demon.

49
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:12,619
Then he made the real gourd tiny and hid it in his robe.

50
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,787
"I'll try to capture Heaven now," said the demon.

51
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:22,191
He held up the gourd. "Heaven!"

52
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:24,344
Nothing happened.

53
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:29,616
"Heaven!" said the demon again. "Heaven! Heaven!"

54
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:32,698
He looked at the gourd.

55
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:35,841
"This gourd isn't working.

56
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:39,581
What's wrong with it?"

57
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:43,755
Wukong laughed and made the fake gourd disappear.

58
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,831
Then he made himself invisible.

59
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:50,110
"I was tricked!" cried the demon.

60
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:54,323
"I must tell Golden Horn."

61
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:58,341
The demon ran off, and Wukong followed.

62
00:03:58,342 --> 00:04:04,709
Soon the road went up a mountain.

63
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,055
The demon ran into a cave.

64
00:04:07,056 --> 00:04:13,848
Wukong made himself visible and stormed into the cave.

65
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:18,708
Looking around at the group of demons, he pulled out his iron bar.

66
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,065
"Return my friends at once!" he shouted.

67
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:25,349
"Or I'll clobber all of you!"

68
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,896
"Ahh!" cried the small demons.

69
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:35,118
They ran in every direction, tripping over one another.

70
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:38,499
Wukong swung his iron bar at Golden Horn.

71
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,141
The demon stepped out of the way and pulled a golden rope from his sleeve.

72
00:04:43,142 --> 00:04:47,512
He swung the rope, and it shot toward Wukong.

73
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:51,741
The monkey tried to get out of the way, but the rope snagged him.

74
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:54,299
It looped around his waist.

75
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,555
The more Wukong tried to wriggle free, the tighter the rope got.

76
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:03,454
Golden Horn laughed.

77
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:07,179
"You'll never escape the golden rope.

78
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:16,061
Tonight I will dine on the Tang Monk!"
