1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:18,034
Guanyin recited the Tight Headband spell.

2
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:22,554
Both Wukongs fell to the ground, howling in pain.

3
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:26,011
"Please stop!" they cried.

4
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:33,191
Guanyin stopped reciting the spell, and the two monkeys stood back up.

5
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:35,375
The bodhisattva frowned.

6
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:39,202
"I still don't know which of you is the real Wukong.

7
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:41,285
[g@You should both go to Heaven.

8
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:44,325
The real Wukong used to live there.@g]

9
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:48,433
Maybe the Jade Emperor can tell who is who."

10
00:00:48,434 --> 00:00:51,295
[g@"Good idea," said one Wukong.

11
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:52,759
He pointed at the other.@g]

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,462
"The Jade Emperor will see that this monkey is a fake!"

13
00:00:57,463 --> 00:01:03,261
"I'm not a fake!" cried the other monkey. "You are!"

14
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:05,811
He tried to strike the other Wukong.

15
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:10,258
But that one dodged the blow and swung back.

16
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:17,816
The two monkeys were still fighting when they arrived [n@at the southern gate of Heaven.

17
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:20,124
[g@The guard narrowed his eyes.

18
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,818
"Wukong? Is that you?"@g]

19
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:26,867
"Yes, it's me," said both of the Wukongs.

20
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:30,580
"I must speak with the Jade Emperor," said one monkey.

21
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:32,411
[g@He pointed at the other monkey.

22
00:01:32,412 --> 00:01:35,214
"He's a fake Wukong!"@g]

23
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:38,616
"I'm not a fake Wukong!" said the other monkey.

24
00:01:38,617 --> 00:01:40,209
[g@"I'm the real one!

25
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,571
I must speak with the Jade Emperor!"@g]

26
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:49,800
The guard allowed both Wukongs to enter Heaven.

27
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,705
[i@Crash! Clang! Bang!@i]

28
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:59,443
Spirits and gods fled as the two Wukongs fought all over Heaven.

29
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:05,192
The monkeys knocked over statues and trees.

30
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:10,157
Still fighting, they stormed into the Cloud Palace.

31
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:14,291
When the Jade Emperor saw them, he was furious.

32
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:17,856
"What's going on?" he boomed.

33
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:21,329
"Your Majesty!" said one of the Wukongs.

34
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,992
[g@"Please punish this monkey.

35
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:25,300
He's pretending to be me."@g]

36
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:27,906
[g@"Punish [i@him!@i]" cried the other.

37
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:31,335
"He's pretending to be me!"@g]

38
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:35,349
"Stand still, both of you," said the Jade Emperor.

39
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:41,658
"Let me get a good look at you."

40
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:47,567
The two Wukongs stood still as the Jade Emperor looked carefully at them.

41
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,743
Finally the emperor shrugged.

42
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:51,461
[g@"You look exactly alike.

43
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,386
I can't tell who is who."@g]

44
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:58,555
One of the Wukongs swung at the other with his iron bar.

45
00:02:58,556 --> 00:03:00,849
"I'm the real Wukong!"

46
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,664
"No!" The other Wukong blocked the bar and swung back.

47
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:09,312
"I'm the real Wukong!"

48
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:13,623
"Both of you, leave at once!" thundered the Jade Emperor.

49
00:03:13,624 --> 00:03:16,545
[g@"One Wukong is bad enough.

50
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:18,830
I don't want two of you around.@g]

51
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:25,978
You can fight somewhere else!"

52
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,910
The two monkeys kept fighting as they headed out of the palace.

53
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:33,942
The spirit of the planet Venus followed them.

54
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:36,850
"Wukong, wait," said the spirit.

55
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,606
Both monkeys stopped to look at him.

56
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:43,196
"Go to the Land of Darkness," said Venus.

57
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:49,788
"Maybe the Judge of the Dead can tell you apart."

58
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:54,735
Soon the two Wukongs were standing before the Judge of the Dead.

59
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,517
[g@The judge shook his head.

60
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:59,752
"You look exactly alike."@g]

61
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:03,320
"Check the Directory," said one of the Wukongs.

62
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:07,196
"Maybe it will have some information about a fake Sun Wukong."

63
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:12,682
"Yes," said the other Wukong. "Check the Directory."

64
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:16,338
The judge nodded and opened the Directory.

65
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,621
He turned the pages of the giant book, reading carefully.

66
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:23,234
Finally he closed it.

67
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:28,348
"There's no 'Fake Sun Wukong' in the Directory," said the judge.

68
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:35,445
"I'm sorry. But I have no idea which one of you is the real Wukong."

69
00:04:35,446 --> 00:04:38,962
A spirit was sitting at a nearby desk.

70
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:44,434
"I believe my pet beast, Curious Ear, can help," said the spirit.

71
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:49,634
He took a step back, and a small beast crept out from under the desk.

72
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:59,681
"Curious Ear can tell the true from the false," said the spirit.

73
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:03,079
The beast stared hard at the two Wukongs.

74
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,778
[g@Finally it spoke.

75
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:12,051
"I know who the fake Sun Wukong is."@g]
