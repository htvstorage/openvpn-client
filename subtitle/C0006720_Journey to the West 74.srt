00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 197:15:10,933.3329999446869
Guanyin recited the Tight Headband spell.

2
197:16:50,933.3329999446869 --> 322:48:30,933.3329999446869
Both Wukongs fell to the ground, howling in pain.

3
322:50:10,933.3329999446869 --> 418:50:10,933.3329999446869
"Please stop!" they cried.

4
418:51:50,933.3329999446869 --> 618:16:50,933.3330001831055
Guanyin stopped reciting the spell, and the two monkeys stood back up.

5
618:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 678:56:50,933.3330001831055
The bodhisattva frowned.

6
678:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 785:15:10,933.3330001831055
"I still don't know which of you is the real Wukong.

7
785:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 843:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@You should both go to Heaven.

8
843:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 927:33:30,933.3330001831055
The real Wukong used to live there.@g]

9
927:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1041:40:10,933.3330001831055
Maybe the Jade Emperor can tell who is who."

10
1041:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1121:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Good idea," said one Wukong.

11
1121:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1161:50:10,933.3330001831055
He pointed at the other.@g]

12
1161:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1292:28:30,933.3330001831055
"The Jade Emperor will see that this monkey is a fake!"

13
1292:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1453:33:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm not a fake!" cried the other monkey. "You are!"

14
1453:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1524:23:30,933.3330001831055
He tried to strike the other Wukong.

15
1524:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1647:55:10,933.3330001831055
But that one dodged the blow and swung back.

16
1647:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1857:51:50,933.3330001831055
The two monkeys were still fighting when they arrived [n@at the southern gate of Heaven.

17
1857:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1921:58:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The guard narrowed his eyes.

18
1922:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1996:48:30,933.3330001831055
"Wukong? Is that you?"@g]

19
1996:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2109:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Yes, it's me," said both of the Wukongs.

20
2109:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2212:25:10,933.3330001831055
"I must speak with the Jade Emperor," said one monkey.

21
2212:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2263:16:50,933.3330001831055
[g@He pointed at the other monkey.

22
2263:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2341:08:30,933.3330001831055
"He's a fake Wukong!"@g]

23
2341:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2435:38:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm not a fake Wukong!" said the other monkey.

24
2435:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2479:53:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"I'm the real one!

2479:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2601:03:30,933.3330001831055

2601:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2746:18:30,933.3330001831055
The guard allowed both Wukongs to enter Heaven.

27
2746:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2827:00:10,933.3330001831055
[i@Crash! Clang! Bang!@i]

28
2827:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3014:10:10,933.3330001831055
Spirits and gods fled as the two Wukongs fought all over Heaven.

29
3014:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3173:51:50,933.3330001831055
The monkeys knocked over statues and trees.

30
3173:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3311:46:50,933.3330001831055
Still fighting, they stormed into the Cloud Palace.

31
3311:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3426:36:50,933.3330001831055
When the Jade Emperor saw them, he was furious.

32
3426:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3525:38:30,933.3330001831055
"What's going on?" he boomed.

33
3525:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3622:06:50,933.3330001831055
"Your Majesty!" said one of the Wukongs.

34
3622:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3668:18:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Please punish this monkey.

3668:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3732:25:10,933.3330001831055
He's pretending to be me."@g]

3732:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3804:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Punish [i@him!@i]" cried the other.

37
3804:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3900:03:30,933.3330001831055
"He's pretending to be me!"@g]

38
3900:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4011:33:30,933.3330001831055
"Stand still, both of you," said the Jade Emperor.

39
4011:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4186:48:30,933.3330001831055
"Let me get a good look at you."

40
4186:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4350:56:50,933.3330001831055
The two Wukongs stood still as the Jade Emperor looked carefully at them.

41
4350:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4411:23:30,933.3330001831055
Finally the emperor shrugged.

42
4411:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4459:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"You look exactly alike.

4459:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4540:21:50,933.3330001831055
I can't tell who is who."@g]

44
4540:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4656:10:10,933.3330001831055
One of the Wukongs swung at the other with his iron bar.

45
4656:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4719:53:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm the real Wukong!"

46
4719:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4825:51:50,933.3330001831055
"No!" The other Wukong blocked the bar and swung back.

47
4825:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4954:58:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm the real Wukong!"

48
4955:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5074:43:30,933.3330001831055
"Both of you, leave at once!" thundered the Jade Emperor.

49
5074:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5155:53:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"One Wukong is bad enough.

50
5155:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5219:21:50,933.3330001831055
I don't want two of you around.@g]

51
5219:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5417:55:10,933.3330001831055
You can fight somewhere else!"

52
5417:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5527:08:30,933.3330001831055
The two monkeys kept fighting as they headed out of the palace.

53
5527:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5639:08:30,933.3330001831055
The spirit of the planet Venus followed them.

54
5639:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5719:55:10,933.3330001831055
"Wukong, wait," said the spirit.

55
5719:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5796:28:30,933.3330001831055
Both monkeys stopped to look at him.

56
5796:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5896:11:50,933.3330001831055
"Go to the Land of Darkness," said Venus.

57
5896:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6079:18:30,933.3330001831055
"Maybe the Judge of the Dead can tell you apart."

58
6079:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6216:43:30,933.3330001831055
Soon the two Wukongs were standing before the Judge of the Dead.

59
6216:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6266:13:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The judge shook his head.

6266:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6356:05:10,933.3330001831055
"You look exactly alike."@g]

61
6356:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6455:11:50,933.3330001831055
"Check the Directory," said one of the Wukongs.

62
6455:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6562:51:50,933.3330001831055
"Maybe it will have some information about a fake Sun Wukong."

63
6562:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6715:15:10,933.3330001831055
"Yes," said the other Wukong. "Check the Directory."

64
6715:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6816:48:30,933.3330001831055
The judge nodded and opened the Directory.

65
6816:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6935:46:50,933.3330001831055
He turned the pages of the giant book, reading carefully.

66
6935:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7008:21:50,933.3330001831055
Finally he closed it.

67
7008:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7150:25:10,933.3330001831055
"There's no 'Fake Sun Wukong' in the Directory," said the judge.

68
7150:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7347:33:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm sorry. But I have no idea which one of you is the real Wukong."

69
7347:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7445:15:10,933.3330001831055
A spirit was sitting at a nearby desk.

70
7445:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7597:15:10,933.3330001831055
"I believe my pet beast, Curious Ear, can help," said the spirit.

71
7597:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7741:41:50,933.3330001831055
He took a step back, and a small beast crept out from under the desk.

72
7741:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8020:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Curious Ear can tell the true from the false," said the spirit.

73
8020:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8115:10:10,933.3330001831055
The beast stared hard at the two Wukongs.

74
8115:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8162:21:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Finally it spoke.

8162:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8364:23:30,933.3330001831055
"I know who the fake Sun Wukong is."@g]
