1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,809
Wukong stared at the river.

2
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,301
"I should have stopped Master from getting in that canoe.

3
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:23,860
But whenever I warn him about someone, he doesn't believe me."

4
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:29,357
Wujing nodded. "I'll find out where that man took our friends."

5
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:35,923
The purple spirit dived into the river.

6
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:39,093
He soon came to a palace.

7
00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:43,906
A sign on the gate read "Home of the Black River God."

8
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:48,638
Wujing tapped on the door with his spear. "Open up!"

9
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:52,229
The door opened, and a lizard peeked out.

10
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,207
"What do you want?" asked the lizard.

11
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,554
"I'm looking for my companions," said Wujing.

12
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:02,277
"One is a monk, and the other is a pig.

13
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:05,138
They were kidnapped by a man."

14
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:09,661
"They were kidnapped by me," said the lizard.

15
00:01:09,662 --> 00:01:12,600
"You?" said Wujing.

16
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:15,413
"Yes." The lizard smiled.

17
00:01:15,414 --> 00:01:21,238
"I plan to eat the Tang Monk and live forever!"

18
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,406
Wujing struck at the lizard with his spear.

19
00:01:24,407 --> 00:01:28,975
The lizard spun around, blocking the spear with his tail.

20
00:01:28,976 --> 00:01:31,967
The force nearly knocked Wujing over.

21
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:35,180
Right away the lizard was on top of him.

22
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:38,039
"Get off me!" shouted Wujing.

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,195
He shoved the lizard.

24
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:43,182
The lizard attacked again.

25
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:47,773
Wujing swung his spear and then swam upward.

26
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:53,151
He splashed out of the river and landed next to Wukong.

27
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:58,513
"There's a lizard demon down there," said Wujing, breathing heavily.

28
00:01:58,514 --> 00:02:01,048
"He's very powerful."

29
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,416
Wukong was about to respond when he noticed someone nearby.

30
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:09,137
The man from the canoe was walking toward them.

31
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:12,129
The monkey pulled out his iron bar.

32
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,993
"How dare you kidnap our friends!"

33
00:02:14,994 --> 00:02:17,780
The man fell to his knees, shaking.

34
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:20,978
"It wasn't me!" he cried.

35
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,089
"It was a lizard demon.

36
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,263
I'm the Black River God, and this is my river.

37
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:29,538
But that lizard pretended he was me!"

38
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:33,192
Wukong put the iron bar back in his ear.

39
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:35,281
"I believe you," he said.

40
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:38,132
"Do you know who the lizard is?"

41
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,435
"I don't," said the river god.

42
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:43,190
He looked even more frightened now.

43
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:47,939
"But his uncle is the mighty Dragon King of the Eastern Sea."

44
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,567
Wukong laughed. "That dragon is a friend of mine.

45
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:54,789
He's also a bit scared of me.

46
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:02,943
I'll go have a talk with him."

47
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:07,506
A moment later the monkey was at the Dragon King's palace.

48
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:11,197
"Hello again, Wukong," said the dragon, smiling.

49
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:14,371
"What can I do for you?"

50
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:19,092
"Why did you let your nephew take over the Black River?" demanded the monkey.

51
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:21,503
The dragon's smile faded.

52
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:23,725
"What are you talking about?"

53
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:28,827
"Your nephew—a lizard demon—took over the Black River," said Wukong.

54
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:32,386
"And now he's planning to eat the Tang Monk."

55
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:36,675
"Oh dear," said the dragon. "I had no idea.

56
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:39,808
I'll take care of it."

57
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:43,748
Wukong and the dragon flew back to the Black River.

58
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:52,500
The Dragon King shouted, "Nephew! Come out of that river at once!"

59
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:54,640
The lizard leaped from the river.

60
00:03:54,641 --> 00:04:00,087
"Uncle!" he said. "It's nice of you to visit."

61
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:03,173
"I'm not here to visit!" yelled the dragon.

62
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:05,941
"I'm here to take you to the Jade Emperor.

63
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:09,210
You will be punished."

64
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:10,867
The lizard gulped.

65
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:16,020
His head hanging low, he followed his uncle up into the sky.

66
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:20,214
With a splash, the river god appeared from the water.

67
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:23,416
The Tang Monk and Bajie were with him.

68
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:26,384
"Thank you, Wukong," said the god.

69
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:29,295
"You're welcome," said the monkey.

70
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:32,640
"But we still need to cross your river."

71
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:35,268
"That's easy," said the river god.

72
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:37,766
He held up his hand.

73
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:43,935
Instantly the river stopped flowing, and the water formed walls.

74
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:54,258
The travelers walked across the muddy riverbed and continued west.
