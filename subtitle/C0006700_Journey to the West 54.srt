1
00:00:11,000 --> 133:35:11,000
Wukong stared at the river.

2
133:36:51,000 --> 258:21:51,000
"I should have stopped Master from getting in that canoe.

3
258:23:31,000 --> 357:13:31,000
But whenever I warn him about someone, he doesn't believe me."

4
357:15:11,000 --> 509:55:11,000
Wujing nodded. "I'll find out where that man took our friends."

5
509:56:51,000 --> 692:18:31,000
[g@The purple spirit dived into the river.

6
692:20:11,000 --> 780:21:51,000
He soon came to a palace.@g]

7
780:23:31,000 --> 914:03:31,000
A sign on the gate read "Home of the Black River God."

8
914:05:11,000 --> 1045:30:11,000
Wujing tapped on the door with his spear. "Open up!"

9
1045:31:51,000 --> 1145:15:11,000
The door opened, and a lizard peeked out.

10
1145:16:51,000 --> 1255:45:11,000
"What do you want?" asked the lizard.

11
1255:46:51,000 --> 1348:43:31,000
"I'm looking for my companions," said Wujing.

12
1348:45:11,000 --> 1424:21:51,000
[g@"One is a monk, and the other is a pig.

13
1424:23:31,000 --> 1503:50:11,000
They were kidnapped by a man."@g]

14
1503:51:51,000 --> 1629:28:31,000
"They were kidnapped by me," said the lizard.

15
1629:30:11,000 --> 1711:06:51,000
"You?" said Wujing.

16
1711:08:31,000 --> 1789:15:11,000
[g@"Yes." The lizard smiled.

17
1789:16:51,000 --> 1951:03:31,000
"I plan to eat the Tang Monk and live forever!"@g]

18
1951:05:11,000 --> 2039:03:31,000
Wujing struck at the lizard with his spear.

19
2039:05:11,000 --> 2165:58:31,000
The lizard spun around, blocking the spear with his tail.

20
2166:00:11,000 --> 2249:05:11,000
The force nearly knocked Wujing over.

21
2249:06:51,000 --> 2338:20:11,000
Right away the lizard was on top of him.

22
2338:21:51,000 --> 2417:45:11,000
[g@"Get off me!" shouted Wujing.

23
2417:46:51,000 --> 2505:25:11,000
He shoved the lizard.@g]

24
2505:26:51,000 --> 2560:36:51,000
[g@The lizard attacked again.

25
2560:38:31,000 --> 2688:08:31,000
Wujing swung his spear and then swam upward.@g]

26
2688:10:11,000 --> 2837:31:51,000
He splashed out of the river and landed next to Wukong.

27
2837:33:31,000 --> 2986:28:31,000
"There's a lizard demon down there," said Wujing, breathing heavily.

28
2986:30:11,000 --> 3056:53:31,000
"He's very powerful."

29
3056:55:11,000 --> 3178:13:31,000
Wukong was about to respond when he noticed someone nearby.

30
3178:15:11,000 --> 3281:35:11,000
The man from the canoe was walking toward them.

31
3281:36:51,000 --> 3364:41:51,000
[g@The monkey pulled out his iron bar.

32
3364:43:31,000 --> 3444:15:11,000
"How dare you kidnap our friends!"@g]

33
3444:16:51,000 --> 3521:40:11,000
[g@The man fell to his knees, shaking.

34
3521:41:51,000 --> 3610:30:11,000
"It wasn't me!" he cried.@g]

35
3610:31:51,000 --> 3669:08:31,000
[g@"It was a lizard demon.

36
3669:10:11,000 --> 3757:18:31,000
I'm the Black River God, and this is my river.@g]

37
3757:20:11,000 --> 3848:16:51,000
But that lizard pretended he was me!"

38
3848:18:31,000 --> 3949:46:51,000
Wukong put the iron bar back in his ear.

39
3949:48:31,000 --> 4007:48:31,000
[g@"I believe you," he said.

40
4007:50:11,000 --> 4087:00:11,000
"Do you know who the lizard is?"@g]

41
4087:01:51,000 --> 4150:58:31,000
[g@"I don't," said the river god.

42
4151:00:11,000 --> 4227:30:11,000
He looked even more frightened now.@g]

43
4227:31:51,000 --> 4359:25:11,000
"But his uncle is the mighty Dragon King of the Eastern Sea."

44
4359:26:51,000 --> 4487:58:31,000
Wukong laughed. "That dragon is a friend of mine.

45
4488:00:11,000 --> 4549:41:51,000
[g@He's also a bit scared of me.

46
4549:43:31,000 --> 4776:11:51,000
I'll go have a talk with him."@g]

47
4776:13:31,000 --> 4902:56:51,000
A moment later the monkey was at the Dragon King's palace.

48
4902:58:31,000 --> 5005:28:31,000
[g@"Hello again, Wukong," said the dragon, smiling.

49
5005:30:11,000 --> 5093:38:31,000
"What can I do for you?"@g]

50
5093:40:11,000 --> 5224:46:51,000
"Why did you let your nephew take over the Black [n@River?" demanded the monkey.

51
5224:48:31,000 --> 5291:45:11,000
[g@The dragon's smile faded.

52
5291:46:51,000 --> 5353:28:31,000
"What are you talking about?"@g]

53
5353:30:11,000 --> 5495:11:51,000
"Your nephew—a lizard demon—took over the Black River," said Wukong.

54
5495:13:31,000 --> 5594:03:31,000
"And now he's planning to eat the Tang Monk."

55
5594:05:11,000 --> 5713:11:51,000
[g@"Oh dear," said the dragon. "I had no idea.

56
5713:13:31,000 --> 5800:13:31,000
I'll take care of it."@g]

57
5800:15:11,000 --> 5909:40:11,000
Wukong and the dragon flew back to the Black River.

58
5909:41:51,000 --> 6152:46:51,000
The Dragon King shouted, "Nephew! Come out of that river at once!"

59
6152:48:31,000 --> 6212:13:31,000
The lizard leaped from the river.

60
6212:15:11,000 --> 6363:31:51,000
"Uncle!" he said. "It's nice of you to visit."

61
6363:33:31,000 --> 6449:15:11,000
"I'm not here to visit!" yelled the dragon.

62
6449:16:51,000 --> 6526:08:31,000
[g@"I'm here to take you to the Jade Emperor.

63
6526:10:11,000 --> 6616:56:51,000
You will be punished."@g]

64
6616:58:31,000 --> 6662:58:31,000
The lizard gulped.

65
6663:00:11,000 --> 6806:06:51,000
His head hanging low, he followed his uncle up into the sky.

66
6806:08:31,000 --> 6922:36:51,000
With a splash, the river god appeared from the water.

67
6922:38:31,000 --> 7011:33:31,000
The Tang Monk and Bajie were with him.

68
7011:35:11,000 --> 7094:00:11,000
"Thank you, Wukong," said the god.

69
7094:01:51,000 --> 7174:51:51,000
"You're welcome," said the monkey.

70
7174:53:31,000 --> 7267:46:51,000
"But we still need to cross your river."

71
7267:48:31,000 --> 7340:46:51,000
[g@"That's easy," said the river god.

72
7340:48:31,000 --> 7410:10:11,000
He held up his hand.@g]

73
7410:11:51,000 --> 7581:31:51,000
Instantly the river stopped flowing, and the water formed walls.

74
7581:33:31,000 --> 7868:16:51,000
The travelers walked across the muddy riverbed and continued west.
