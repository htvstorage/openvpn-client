1
00:00:11,000 --> 180:51:51,000
The demon tied up the Tang Monk in a dark room.

2
180:53:31,000 --> 283:03:31,000
Then the demon dragged in Bajie and Wujing.

3
283:05:11,000 --> 443:21:51,000
They were still trapped in the vests.

4
443:23:31,000 --> 568:01:51,000
The demon dumped them in a corner and approached the monk.

5
568:03:31,000 --> 750:16:51,000
"I've been hoping you would pass my mountain," [n@the demon said with an evil smile.

6
750:18:31,000 --> 825:35:11,000
"Please let us go," said the Tang Monk.

7
825:36:51,000 --> 909:55:11,000
"We're trying to reach the Western Paradise."

8
909:56:51,000 --> 1016:20:11,000
"I know where you're going," said the demon.

9
1016:21:51,000 --> 1174:15:11,000
"I also know that I'll live forever if I eat you."

10
1174:16:51,000 --> 1286:58:31,000
"Who are you?" demanded Wujing from the corner.

11
1287:00:11,000 --> 1366:10:11,000
[g@The demon turned to face him.

12
1366:11:51,000 --> 1472:48:31,000
"I am One-Horned Buffalo."@g]

13
1472:50:11,000 --> 1570:36:51,000
[g@"Our friend will find us soon," said Bajie.

14
1570:38:31,000 --> 1619:11:51,000
"He's very powerful.@g]

15
1619:13:31,000 --> 1755:41:51,000
And when he learns that you kidnapped us, he'll [n@destroy your entire mountain."

16
1755:43:31,000 --> 1826:56:51,000
[g@One-Horned Buffalo smirked.

17
1826:58:31,000 --> 1890:58:31,000
"Who is your friend?"@g]

18
1891:00:11,000 --> 1989:18:31,000
"His name is Sun Wukong," said Bajie.

19
1989:20:11,000 --> 2060:58:31,000
The demon's smirk disappeared.

20
2061:00:11,000 --> 2160:05:11,000
"Is he the Sun Wukong who caused trouble in Heaven?"

21
2160:06:51,000 --> 2233:40:11,000
The demon sounded nervous.

22
2233:41:51,000 --> 2319:55:11,000
[g@"Yes, he is," said Wujing.

23
2319:56:51,000 --> 2414:41:51,000
"Heaven's entire army couldn't defeat him."@g]

24
2414:43:31,000 --> 2540:13:31,000
"Even the Jade Emperor is afraid of him," Bajie added.

25
2540:15:11,000 --> 2627:36:51,000
[g@One-Horned Buffalo stood taller.

26
2627:38:31,000 --> 2733:38:31,000
"Well, I'm not afraid of him!"@g]

27
2733:40:11,000 --> 2855:16:51,000
The demon walked out of the room.

28
2855:18:31,000 --> 2966:38:31,000
Once he was away from the others though, he grew worried again.

29
2966:40:11,000 --> 3071:55:11,000
"That monkey is powerful," he said to himself.

30
3071:56:51,000 --> 3183:53:31,000
"I'm going to need my special weapon to defeat him."

31
3183:55:11,000 --> 3368:23:31,000
He lifted his sleeve, revealing a metal ring around his arm.

32
3368:25:11,000 --> 3529:53:31,000
Carrying food, Wukong returned to where he'd left his friends.

33
3529:55:11,000 --> 3628:10:11,000
When he didn't see them, he looked up toward the monastery.

34
3628:11:51,000 --> 3690:31:51,000
[g@The building was gone.

35
3690:33:31,000 --> 3793:41:51,000
In its place was a dark cave.@g]

36
3793:43:31,000 --> 3858:26:51,000
[g@Wukong shook his head.

37
3858:28:31,000 --> 3937:38:31,000
"That monastery was an illusion.@g]

38
3937:40:11,000 --> 4054:38:31,000
[g@A demon must have made it to trick people."

39
4054:40:11,000 --> 4114:25:11,000
He stamped his foot.@g]

40
4114:26:51,000 --> 4230:15:11,000
"Why don't my friends believe me when I warn them about demons?"

41
4230:16:51,000 --> 4391:18:31,000
He put down the food and rushed to the cave.

42
4391:20:11,000 --> 4453:46:51,000
"Open up!" shouted the monkey.

43
4453:48:31,000 --> 4608:03:31,000
"If you don't, I'll turn this entire mountain into a pile of rubble!"

44
4608:05:11,000 --> 4741:28:31,000
The door flew open, and One-Horned Buffalo stepped out.

45
4741:30:11,000 --> 4887:18:31,000
"Why are you yelling?" demanded the demon. "It's rude!"

46
4887:20:11,000 --> 4996:28:31,000
"Release my friends!" yelled Wukong.

47
4996:30:11,000 --> 5115:31:51,000
"No." One-Horned Buffalo folded his arms.

48
5115:33:31,000 --> 5189:20:11,000
"I'm not going to release your friends.

49
5189:21:51,000 --> 5342:53:31,000
They're criminals. They stole my valuable silk vests."

50
5342:55:11,000 --> 5427:43:31,000
[g@"That's a lie," said Wukong.

51
5427:45:11,000 --> 5512:01:51,000
"The Tang Monk is a good and honest man.@g]

52
5512:03:31,000 --> 5556:16:51,000
[g@He would never steal.

53
5556:18:31,000 --> 5638:46:51,000
I can't believe you would even suggestâ€” "@g]

54
5638:48:31,000 --> 5758:03:31,000
"It was the pig," said the demon.

55
5758:05:11,000 --> 5857:41:51,000
"Oh." The monkey scratched his head.

56
5857:43:31,000 --> 5897:16:51,000
[g@"Well, then I believe you.

57
5897:18:31,000 --> 5972:03:31,000
But that doesn't matter!"@g]

58
5972:05:11,000 --> 6099:43:31,000
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and swung it at the demon.

59
6099:45:11,000 --> 6264:13:31,000
One-Horned Buffalo dodged the bar, which smashed into the mountainside.

60
6264:15:11,000 --> 6375:15:11,000
Rocks exploded and tumbled down the mountain's slope.

61
6375:16:51,000 --> 6437:10:11,000
The demon glared at Wukong.

62
6437:11:51,000 --> 6484:10:11,000
[g@"I remember you.

63
6484:11:51,000 --> 6593:35:11,000
The Jade Emperor might fear you, but I don't!"@g]

64
6593:36:51,000 --> 6730:45:11,000
He rushed at Wukong, and the monkey swung his iron bar again.

65
6730:46:51,000 --> 6841:51:51,000
The demon blocked it with his arm. [i@Bam!@i]

66
6841:53:31,000 --> 6971:26:51,000
"Ow!" cried One-Horned Buffalo, rubbing his arm.

67
6971:28:31,000 --> 7081:40:11,000
He fell to his knees and turned his back to the monkey.

68
7081:41:51,000 --> 7202:51:51,000
"My iron bar is not an ordinary weapon," said Wukong.

69
7202:53:31,000 --> 7283:28:31,000
[g@"It's extremely heavy."

70
7283:30:11,000 --> 7379:56:51,000
He noticed the demon reaching up his sleeve.@g]

71
7379:58:31,000 --> 7433:08:31,000
"What are you doing?"

72
7433:10:11,000 --> 7567:35:11,000
One-Horned Buffalo spun around, holding up the metal ring.

73
7567:36:51,000 --> 7688:58:31,000
Instantly Wukong felt himself being pulled toward the ring.

74
7689:00:11,000 --> 7830:58:31,000
Using all of his strength, the monkey leaped into the air.

75
7831:00:11,000 --> 7910:36:51,000
But the bar was ripped from his hands.

76
7910:38:31,000 --> 8118:30:11,000
It flew into the metal ring and vanished.
