1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,511
The demon tied up the Tang Monk in a dark room.

2
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:21,190
Then the demon dragged in Bajie and Wujing.

3
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:26,961
They were still trapped in the vests.

4
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:31,449
The demon dumped them in a corner and approached the monk.

5
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:38,010
"I've been hoping you would pass my mountain," the demon said with an evil smile.

6
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:40,721
"Please let us go," said the Tang Monk.

7
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:43,757
"We're trying to reach the Western Paradise."

8
00:00:43,758 --> 00:00:47,588
"I know where you're going," said the demon.

9
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:53,273
"I also know that I'll live forever if I eat you."

10
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:57,331
"Who are you?" demanded Wujing from the corner.

11
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:00,182
The demon turned to face him.

12
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:04,021
"I am One-Horned Buffalo."

13
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,542
"Our friend will find us soon," said Bajie.

14
00:01:07,543 --> 00:01:09,291
"He's very powerful.

15
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:14,205
And when he learns that you kidnapped us, he'll destroy your entire mountain."

16
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:16,770
One-Horned Buffalo smirked.

17
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:19,075
"Who is your friend?"

18
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:22,615
"His name is Sun Wukong," said Bajie.

19
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,195
The demon's smirk disappeared.

20
00:01:25,196 --> 00:01:28,763
"Is he the Sun Wukong who caused trouble in Heaven?"

21
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:31,412
The demon sounded nervous.

22
00:01:31,413 --> 00:01:34,517
"Yes, he is," said Wujing.

23
00:01:34,518 --> 00:01:37,929
"Heaven's entire army couldn't defeat him."

24
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,448
"Even the Jade Emperor is afraid of him," Bajie added.

25
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:45,594
One-Horned Buffalo stood taller.

26
00:01:45,595 --> 00:01:49,411
"Well, I'm not afraid of him!"

27
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:53,790
The demon walked out of the room.

28
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,799
Once he was away from the others though, he grew worried again.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,589
"That monkey is powerful," he said to himself.

30
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,620
"I'm going to need my special weapon to defeat him."

31
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:12,262
He lifted his sleeve, revealing a metal ring around his arm.

32
00:02:12,263 --> 00:02:18,076
Carrying food, Wukong returned to where he'd left his friends.

33
00:02:18,077 --> 00:02:21,614
When he didn't see them, he looked up toward the monastery.

34
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:23,859
The building was gone.

35
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,573
In its place was a dark cave.

36
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:29,904
Wukong shook his head.

37
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:32,755
"That monastery was an illusion.

38
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:36,967
A demon must have made it to trick people."

39
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:39,119
He stamped his foot.

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,289
"Why don't my friends believe me when I warn them about demons?"

41
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,087
He put down the food and rushed to the cave.

42
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:51,336
"Open up!" shouted the monkey.

43
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:56,890
"If you don't, I'll turn this entire mountain into a pile of rubble!"

44
00:02:56,891 --> 00:03:01,693
The door flew open, and One-Horned Buffalo stepped out.

45
00:03:01,694 --> 00:03:06,943
"Why are you yelling?" demanded the demon. "It's rude!"

46
00:03:06,944 --> 00:03:10,873
"Release my friends!" yelled Wukong.

47
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:15,159
"No." One-Horned Buffalo folded his arms.

48
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,816
"I'm not going to release your friends.

49
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:23,344
They're criminals. They stole my valuable silk vests."

50
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:26,398
"That's a lie," said Wukong.

51
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:29,433
"The Tang Monk is a good and honest man.

52
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:31,026
He would never steal.

53
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:33,996
I can't believe you would even suggestâ€” "

54
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:38,290
"It was the pig," said the demon.

55
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,877
"Oh." The monkey scratched his head.

56
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:43,302
"Well, then I believe you.

57
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:45,994
But that doesn't matter!"

58
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:50,590
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and swung it at the demon.

59
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:56,512
One-Horned Buffalo dodged the bar, which smashed into the mountainside.

60
00:03:56,513 --> 00:04:00,509
Rocks exploded and tumbled down the mountain's slope.

61
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,738
The demon glared at Wukong.

62
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,430
"I remember you.

63
00:04:04,431 --> 00:04:08,369
The Jade Emperor might fear you, but I don't!"

64
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,307
He rushed at Wukong, and the monkey swung his iron bar again.

65
00:04:13,308 --> 00:04:17,307
The demon blocked it with his arm. Bam!

66
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:21,972
"Ow!" cried One-Horned Buffalo, rubbing his arm.

67
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:25,940
He fell to his knees and turned his back to the monkey.

68
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:30,303
"My iron bar is not an ordinary weapon," said Wukong.

69
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:33,205
"It's extremely heavy."

70
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,678
He noticed the demon reaching up his sleeve.

71
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,593
"What are you doing?"

72
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:43,433
One-Horned Buffalo spun around, holding up the metal ring.

73
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:47,803
Instantly Wukong felt himself being pulled toward the ring.

74
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:52,915
Using all of his strength, the monkey leaped into the air.

75
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,782
But the bar was ripped from his hands.

76
00:04:55,783 --> 00:05:03,266
It flew into the metal ring and vanished.
