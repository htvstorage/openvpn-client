1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:18,336
Wukong was once again traveling west with the Tang Monk.

2
00:00:18,337 --> 00:00:20,882
[g@"Master," said Wukong.

3
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:24,346
"While I was at Mount Potalaka, I thought a lot.@g]

4
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:26,946
[g@I realize now that it's wrong to harm people.

5
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:29,622
I won't ever do it again."@g]

6
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:33,617
"I'm glad, Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

7
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:37,309
[g@"Can we please slow down?" Bajie moaned.

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,986
"I'm tired and it's hot!"@g]

9
00:00:40,987 --> 00:00:42,398
Wukong laughed.

10
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,656
[g@"Not much has changed since I left.

11
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:48,304
Bajie still complains all the time!"@g]

12
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:50,766
Wujing wiped his brow.

13
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:52,585
[g@"It [i@is@i] hot.

14
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,132
Maybe we should take a break."@g]

15
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,852
"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

16
00:00:57,853 --> 00:01:00,478
[g@"But I don't understand why it's so hot.

17
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,376
It's not summer."@g]

18
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:07,419
The travelers soon reached a village.

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,405
An old man offered to take them in for the night.

20
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:16,643
Later that evening they were all eating dinner.

21
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:20,970
"Is it always so hot here?" asked Bajie.

22
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:25,399
[g@The man nodded. "The Mountain of Flames is near here.

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,626
It's always burning."@g]

24
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:34,004
"Well, I'll be happy when we continue on our journey," said the pig.

25
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:37,407
"Then we can get away from this heat."

26
00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:41,003
"Where are you going?" asked the man.

27
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:44,856
"We're going to the Western Paradise," said the Tang Monk.

28
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:46,926
[g@The man frowned.

29
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:50,061
"You can't travel west from here."@g]

30
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:53,921
Everyone stopped eating and looked at the old man.

31
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:57,096
"Why not?" asked the Tang Monk.

32
00:01:57,097 --> 00:02:01,393
"The Mountain of Flames is to the west," said the man.

33
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:04,405
"It's impossible to pass."

34
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:07,917
"We'll go around it," said the Tang Monk.

35
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:11,932
The old man shook his head.

36
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:16,195
"All the land around the mountain is covered in flames.

37
00:02:16,196 --> 00:02:19,833
The land stretches far to the north and the south.

38
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:23,640
It's impossible to go around."

39
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:27,737
"Then we must wait for a strong rainstorm," said Bajie.

40
00:02:27,738 --> 00:02:30,350
"That will put out the flames."

41
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,467
"No," said the man.

42
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:34,755
[g@"The flames are magical.

43
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:38,561
There is just one spirit who can put them out."@g]

44
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:41,336
"Who?" asked Wujing.

45
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:45,365
"She's called the Iron Immortal," said the man.

46
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:49,003
"She has a special fan that can put out the flames.

47
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:52,332
It's made from a plantain leaf."

48
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,891
[g@Wukong stood up.

49
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:56,476
"Where does the Iron Immortal live?@g]

50
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:59,611
I'll demand that she put out the flames."

51
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,921
[g@"She won't listen to you," said the man.

52
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:05,572
"She is very powerful."@g]

53
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:09,041
Wukong folded his arms in front of his chest.

54
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:11,753
[g@"I am as powerful as a god.

55
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:14,639
Just tell me where she lives."@g]

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,973
The old man told Wukong where the Iron Immortal lived.

57
00:03:18,974 --> 00:03:24,344
The monkey leaped into the air.

58
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:29,649
The man gasped. "He's a spirit!"

59
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,380
Wukong was soon on the Iron Immortal's mountain.

60
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,367
He found a cave door and knocked.

61
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:39,888
"Open up!" he demanded.

62
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,129
[g@The door flew open, and a tall woman appeared.

63
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,548
She held a large fan.@g]

64
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,567
"Who are you?" she asked.

65
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:50,550
[g@"I am Sun Wukong.

66
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:53,163
I need to borrow your fan.@g]

67
00:03:53,164 --> 00:03:57,756
[g@"Sun Wukong? Ugh!" cried the Iron Immortal.

68
00:03:57,757 --> 00:04:00,435
"You are my worst enemy!"@g]

69
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:04,517
Wukong was confused. "I am? Why?"

70
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:07,447
The Iron Immortal glared at the monkey.

71
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:12,363
"My husband is the Bull Demon King, who used to be your friend.

72
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:15,316
And our son is Red Boy.

73
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:22,141
Because of you, Red Boy is a prisoner of the bodhisattva Guanyin!"

74
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:26,022
Wukong laughed. "Red Boy isn't a prisoner.

75
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:28,308
[g@He is Guanyin's student.

76
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:33,408
He isn't evil anymore."@g]

77
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,468
[g@The Iron Immortal shrieked.

78
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:38,263
"That's even worse!"@g]

79
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:40,010
[g@Wukong sighed.

80
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:44,035
"Can I please just borrow your fan for a little while?"@g]

81
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:47,473
"No!" said the woman.

82
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:51,906
"Well then, can I speak with the Bull Demon King?" asked the monkey.

83
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:58,243
"He's at a banquet," said the Iron Immortal. "Now leave!"

84
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:00,288
[g@Wukong grew angry.

85
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:04,937
"I'm not leaving until I borrow yourâ€”"@g]

86
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:08,882
[i@Whoosh!@i] The Iron Immortal waved the fan.

87
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:16,795
A furious wind blew, and Wukong was gone!
