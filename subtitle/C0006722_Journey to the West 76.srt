Wukong was once again traveling west with the Tang Monk.

205:40:10,933.3329999446869 --> 276:21:50,933.3329999446869
[g@"Master," said Wukong.

276:23:30,933.3329999446869 --> 372:35:10,933.3329999446869
"While I was at Mount Potalaka, I thought a lot.@g]

372:36:50,933.3329999446869 --> 444:48:30,933.3329999446869
[g@I realize now that it's wrong to harm people.

444:50:10,933.3329999446869 --> 519:08:30,933.3329999446869

"I'm glad, Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

7
630:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 732:40:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Can we please slow down?" Bajie moaned.

8
732:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 834:48:30,933.3330001831055

834:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 874:01:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong laughed.

10
874:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 936:45:10,933.3330001831055

1038:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1106:28:30,933.3330001831055
Wujing wiped his brow.

13
1106:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1157:00:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"It [i@is@i] hot.

1157:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1227:45:10,933.3330001831055
Maybe we should take a break."@g]

15
1227:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1303:18:30,933.3330001831055
"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

16
1303:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1376:15:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"But I don't understand why it's so hot.

1376:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1456:45:10,933.3330001831055
It's not summer."@g]

1456:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1569:03:30,933.3330001831055
The travelers soon reached a village.

19
1569:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1707:33:30,933.3330001831055
An old man offered to take them in for the night.

20
1707:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1825:16:50,933.3330001831055
Later that evening they were all eating dinner.

21
1825:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1945:28:30,933.3330001831055
"Is it always so hot here?" asked Bajie.

1945:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2068:30:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The man nodded. "The Mountain of Flames is near here.

2068:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2158:08:30,933.3330001831055
It's always burning."@g]

24
2158:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2307:31:50,933.3330001831055
"Well, I'll be happy when we continue on our journey," said the pig.

25
2307:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2402:03:30,933.3330001831055
"Then we can get away from this heat."

26
2402:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2501:56:50,933.3330001831055
"Where are you going?" asked the man.

27
2501:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2608:58:30,933.3330001831055
"We're going to the Western Paradise," said the Tang Monk.

28
2609:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2666:28:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The man frowned.

2666:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2753:33:30,933.3330001831055
"You can't travel west from here."@g]

30
2753:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2860:46:50,933.3330001831055
Everyone stopped eating and looked at the old man.

31
2860:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2948:58:30,933.3330001831055
"Why not?" asked the Tang Monk.

32
2949:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3068:20:10,933.3330001831055
"The Mountain of Flames is to the west," said the man.

33
3068:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3152:00:10,933.3330001831055
"It's impossible to pass."

34
3152:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3249:33:30,933.3330001831055
"We'll go around it," said the Tang Monk.

35
3249:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3361:05:10,933.3330001831055
The old man shook his head.

36
3361:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3479:30:10,933.3330001831055
"All the land around the mountain is covered in flames.

3479:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3580:33:30,933.3330001831055
The land stretches far to the north and the south.

38
3580:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3686:18:30,933.3330001831055
It's impossible to go around."

39
3686:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3800:06:50,933.3330001831055
"Then we must wait for a strong rainstorm," said Bajie.

40
3800:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3872:41:50,933.3330001831055
"That will put out the flames."

3872:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3931:30:10,933.3330001831055
"No," said the man.

3931:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3995:03:30,933.3330001831055

4100:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4177:51:50,933.3330001831055
"Who?" asked Wujing.

45
4177:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4289:46:50,933.3330001831055
"She's called the Iron Immortal," said the man.

46
4289:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4390:50:10,933.3330001831055
"She has a special fan that can put out the flames.

4390:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4483:18:30,933.3330001831055
It's made from a plantain leaf."

48
4483:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4526:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong stood up.

49
4526:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4598:25:10,933.3330001831055
"Where does the Iron Immortal live?@g]

4598:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4685:30:10,933.3330001831055
I'll demand that she put out the flames."

4685:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4777:26:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"She won't listen to you," said the man.

4777:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4851:05:10,933.3330001831055
"She is very powerful."@g]

4851:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4947:26:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong folded his arms in front of his chest.

54
4947:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5022:46:50,933.3330001831055

5102:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5223:20:10,933.3330001831055
The old man told Wukong where the Iron Immortal lived.

5223:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5372:31:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey leaped into the air.

5372:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5519:53:30,933.3330001831055

5519:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5651:18:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong was soon on the Iron Immortal's mountain.

5651:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5734:16:50,933.3330001831055

5804:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5894:20:10,933.3330001831055

6488:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6569:50:10,933.3330001831055
