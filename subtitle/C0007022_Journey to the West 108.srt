1
00:00:11,000 --> 187:45:11,000
The travelers flew through the sky over the Tang Empire.

2
187:46:51,000 --> 307:58:31,000
Tears of happiness rolled down the Tang Monk's cheeks.

3
308:00:11,000 --> 582:58:31,000
"I see the emperor's palace!"

4
583:00:11,000 --> 786:36:51,000
"I will wait here while you all deliver [n@the True Scriptures," said the guard.

5
786:38:31,000 --> 979:58:31,000
The Tang Monk and his companions went down to Earth and entered the palace.

6
980:00:11,000 --> 1042:53:31,000
[g@The emperor's eyes lit up.

7
1042:55:11,000 --> 1172:46:51,000
"My brother!" He embraced the monk.@g]

8
1172:48:31,000 --> 1272:20:11,000
"For many years I wondered if I'd ever see you again.

9
1272:21:51,000 --> 1339:01:51,000
Did you get the True Scriptures?"

10
1339:03:31,000 --> 1392:53:31,000
"Yes," said the monk.

11
1392:55:11,000 --> 1436:38:31,000
[g@"But please forgive me.

12
1436:40:11,000 --> 1528:21:51,000
The journey took much longer than I expected."@g]

13
1528:23:31,000 --> 1633:50:11,000
"There's no need to apologize," said the emperor.

14
1633:51:51,000 --> 1710:43:31,000
[g@Then he noticed the monk's companions.

15
1710:45:11,000 --> 1772:11:51,000
"Who are they?"@g]

16
1772:13:31,000 --> 1850:58:31,000
Wukong stepped forward.

17
1851:00:11,000 --> 1951:36:51,000
[g@"I am Sun Wukong, the Monkey King.

18
1951:38:31,000 --> 2059:21:51,000
I once defeated Heaven's entire army."@g]

19
2059:23:31,000 --> 2176:40:11,000
"And I am Zhu Bajie," said the pig.

20
2176:41:51,000 --> 2293:03:31,000
"My name is Sha Wujing," said the purple spirit.

21
2293:05:11,000 --> 2394:18:31,000
"They protected me during the journey," the monk explained.

22
2394:20:11,000 --> 2499:25:11,000
"I couldn't have reached the Western Paradise without them."

23
2499:26:51,000 --> 2609:23:31,000
The emperor bowed to Wukong and the others.

24
2609:25:11,000 --> 2666:48:31,000
[g@The monkey laughed.

25
2666:50:11,000 --> 2713:15:11,000
"You don't need to bow.

26
2713:16:51,000 --> 2759:48:31,000
We were happy to help.@g]

27
2759:50:11,000 --> 2806:38:31,000
[g@Well, Wujing and I were.

28
2806:40:11,000 --> 2908:25:11,000
Bajie complained the entire time."@g]

29
2908:26:51,000 --> 3030:36:51,000
The pig snorted.

30
3030:38:31,000 --> 3111:11:51,000
There was a huge feast that night.

31
3111:13:31,000 --> 3232:05:11,000
The emperor asked the monk many questions about the journey.

32
3232:06:51,000 --> 3426:06:51,000
He listened in amazement to the monk's stories.

33
3426:08:31,000 --> 3560:03:31,000
"I will build a magnificent pagoda," the emperor declared.

34
3560:05:11,000 --> 3700:16:51,000
"The True Scriptures will be kept safe inside it."

35
3700:18:31,000 --> 3782:33:31,000
He put his hand on the monk's shoulder.

36
3782:35:11,000 --> 3934:03:31,000
"You will always be remembered as the brave monk who traveled to the West.

37
3934:05:11,000 --> 4066:10:11,000
Because of you, our people won't have to suffer anymore."

38
4066:11:51,000 --> 4225:30:11,000
After the food was eaten, the emperor asked [n@the monk to read from the scriptures.

39
4225:31:51,000 --> 4274:45:11,000
[g@The Tang Monk smiled.

40
4274:46:51,000 --> 4449:51:51,000
"I would be happy to read from them."@g]

41
4449:53:31,000 --> 4622:05:11,000
The monk sat on a platform, where the scriptures had been placed in baskets.

42
4622:06:51,000 --> 4772:41:51,000
He unrolled a scroll.

43
4772:43:31,000 --> 4919:15:11,000
Suddenly light filled the room.

44
4919:16:51,000 --> 5112:11:51,000
The Tang Monk and his companions rose into the sky.

45
5112:13:31,000 --> 5245:21:51,000
"We should return to the Thunderclap Monastery," said the guard.

46
5245:23:31,000 --> 5320:03:31,000
"Buddha is waiting for you."

47
5320:05:11,000 --> 5631:31:51,000
"Yes, let's go," said the monk.

48
5631:33:31,000 --> 5740:41:51,000
The travelers were soon bowing before Buddha again.

49
5740:43:31,000 --> 5858:40:11,000
Other buddhas and bodhisattvas stood behind him.

50
5858:41:51,000 --> 5946:43:31,000
Buddha addressed the horse first.

51
5946:45:11,000 --> 6112:41:51,000
"You carried the Tang Monk on the journey and [n@earned forgiveness for your crimes.

52
6112:43:31,000 --> 6258:40:11,000
You will now be a golden dragon in Heaven."

53
6258:41:51,000 --> 6483:33:31,000
Light flashed as a large golden dragon soared into the sky.

54
6483:35:11,000 --> 6548:11:51,000
"Wujing," said Buddha.

55
6548:13:31,000 --> 6662:01:51,000
"You too have earned forgiveness for your past crimes.

56
6662:03:31,000 --> 6785:43:31,000
You will now be a golden deity."

57
6785:45:11,000 --> 6880:26:51,000
[g@Wujing's body turned gold.

58
6880:28:31,000 --> 6927:36:51,000
The spirit bowed.

59
6927:38:31,000 --> 6987:35:11,000
"Thank you, Buddha."@g]

60
6987:36:51,000 --> 7109:36:51,000
"You have earned forgiveness, Bajie," said Buddha.

61
7109:38:31,000 --> 7392:20:11,000
"You will be Janitor of the Altarsâ€”an important deity [n@who looks after Buddhist altars."

62
7392:21:51,000 --> 7498:28:31,000
Bajie bowed. "Thank you, Buddha."

63
7498:30:11,000 --> 7595:11:51,000
Buddha next turned to the Tang Monk.

64
7595:13:31,000 --> 7753:03:31,000
"Because of you, the people in the East will never have to suffer again.

65
7753:05:11,000 --> 7864:03:31,000
[g@"You made a journey that no other person could make.

66
7864:05:11,000 --> 7962:21:51,000
You are now a buddha."@g]

67
7962:23:31,000 --> 8118:46:51,000
Light glowed around the monk, who bowed before Buddha.

68
8118:48:31,000 --> 8198:40:11,000
"Thank you, Buddha," said the monk.

69
8198:41:51,000 --> 8281:16:51,000
Finally Buddha turned to the monkey.

70
8281:18:31,000 --> 8380:11:51,000
[g@"And you, Wukong," he began.

71
8380:13:31,000 --> 8475:46:51,000
"Your crimes long ago were terrible.@g]

72
8475:48:31,000 --> 8683:53:31,000
But since then you have used your tremendous powers to do good deeds.

73
8683:55:11,000 --> 9039:48:31,000
You too are now a buddha."

74
9039:50:11,000 --> 9200:01:51,000
Wukong bowed. "Thank you, Buddha."

75
9200:03:31,000 --> 9348:18:31,000
"Hey . . ." The monkey suddenly noticed that his head felt different.

76
9348:20:11,000 --> 9423:41:51,000
"The headband is gone!"

77
9423:43:31,000 --> 9537:23:31,000
Buddha smiled. "You don't need it anymore."

78
9537:25:11,000 --> 9823:18:31,000
Filled with joy, Wukong and the Tang Monk joined [n@the other buddhas and bodhisattvas.

79
9823:20:11,000 --> 10388:35:11,000
They have been in the Western Paradise ever since.
