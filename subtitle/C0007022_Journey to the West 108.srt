1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,759
The travelers flew through the sky over the Tang Empire.

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,087
Tears of happiness rolled down the Tang Monk's cheeks.

3
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:31,987
"I see the emperor's palace!"

4
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:39,318
"I will wait here while you all deliver [n@the True Scriptures," said the guard.

5
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:46,279
The Tang Monk and his companions went down to Earth and entered the palace.

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,544
[g@The emperor's eyes lit up.

7
00:00:48,545 --> 00:00:53,220
"My brother!" He embraced the monk.@g]

8
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:56,804
"For many years I wondered if I'd ever see you again.

9
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:59,205
Did you get the True Scriptures?"

10
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:01,144
"Yes," said the monk.

11
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,719
[g@"But please forgive me.

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,021
The journey took much longer than I expected."@g]

13
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:09,818
"There's no need to apologize," said the emperor.

14
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,586
[g@Then he noticed the monk's companions.

15
00:01:12,587 --> 00:01:14,799
"Who are they?"@g]

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,635
Wukong stepped forward.

17
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:21,258
[g@"I am Sun Wukong, the Monkey King.

18
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:25,137
I once defeated Heaven's entire army."@g]

19
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:29,360
"And I am Zhu Bajie," said the pig.

20
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:33,550
"My name is Sha Wujing," said the purple spirit.

21
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,195
"They protected me during the journey," the monk explained.

22
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:40,979
"I couldn't have reached the Western Paradise without them."

23
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,938
The emperor bowed to Wukong and the others.

24
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,005
[g@The monkey laughed.

25
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,677
"You don't need to bow.

26
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:50,353
We were happy to help.@g]

27
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:52,039
[g@Well, Wujing and I were.

28
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,703
Bajie complained the entire time."@g]

29
00:01:55,704 --> 00:02:00,102
The pig snorted.

30
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:03,003
There was a huge feast that night.

31
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:07,355
The emperor asked the monk many questions about the journey.

32
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:14,340
He listened in amazement to the monk's stories.

33
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:19,162
"I will build a magnificent pagoda," the emperor declared.

34
00:02:19,163 --> 00:02:24,210
"The True Scriptures will be kept safe inside it."

35
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,172
He put his hand on the monk's shoulder.

36
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:32,626
"You will always be remembered as the brave monk who traveled to the West.

37
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:37,382
Because of you, our people won't have to suffer anymore."

38
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:43,118
After the food was eaten, the emperor asked [n@the monk to read from the scriptures.

39
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,891
[g@The Tang Monk smiled.

40
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:51,195
"I would be happy to read from them."@g]

41
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:57,395
The monk sat on a platform, where the scriptures had been placed in baskets.

42
00:02:57,396 --> 00:03:02,817
He unrolled a scroll.

43
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:08,093
Suddenly light filled the room.

44
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:15,039
The Tang Monk and his companions rose into the sky.

45
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,833
"We should return to the Thunderclap Monastery," said the guard.

46
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,522
"Buddha is waiting for you."

47
00:03:22,523 --> 00:03:33,735
"Yes, let's go," said the monk.

48
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:37,665
The travelers were soon bowing before Buddha again.

49
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:41,912
Other buddhas and bodhisattvas stood behind him.

50
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:45,082
Buddha addressed the horse first.

51
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:51,057
"You carried the Tang Monk on the journey and [n@earned forgiveness for your crimes.

52
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:56,312
You will now be a golden dragon in Heaven."

53
00:03:56,313 --> 00:04:04,408
Light flashed as a large golden dragon soared into the sky.

54
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,735
"Wujing," said Buddha.

55
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:10,833
"You too have earned forgiveness for your past crimes.

56
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:15,286
You will now be a golden deity."

57
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:18,696
[g@Wujing's body turned gold.

58
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:20,394
The spirit bowed.

59
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:22,553
"Thank you, Buddha."@g]

60
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,946
"You have earned forgiveness, Bajie," said Buddha.

61
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:37,124
"You will be Janitor of the Altarsâ€”an important deity [n@who looks after Buddhist altars."

62
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,945
Bajie bowed. "Thank you, Buddha."

63
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:44,427
Buddha next turned to the Tang Monk.

64
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:50,110
"Because of you, the people in the East will never have to suffer again.

65
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:54,106
[g@"You made a journey that no other person could make.

66
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:57,645
You are now a buddha."@g]

67
00:04:57,646 --> 00:05:03,276
Light glowed around the monk, who bowed before Buddha.

68
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:06,152
"Thank you, Buddha," said the monk.

69
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:09,126
Finally Buddha turned to the monkey.

70
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:12,687
[g@"And you, Wukong," he began.

71
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:16,128
"Your crimes long ago were terrible.@g]

72
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:23,620
But since then you have used your tremendous powers to do good deeds.

73
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:36,433
You too are now a buddha."

74
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:42,201
Wukong bowed. "Thank you, Buddha."

75
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:47,539
"Hey . . ." The monkey suddenly noticed that his head felt different.

76
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,253
"The headband is gone!"

77
00:05:50,254 --> 00:05:54,346
Buddha smiled. "You don't need it anymore."

78
00:05:54,347 --> 00:06:04,639
Filled with joy, Wukong and the Tang Monk joined [n@the other buddhas and bodhisattvas.

79
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:24,989
They have been in the Western Paradise ever since.
