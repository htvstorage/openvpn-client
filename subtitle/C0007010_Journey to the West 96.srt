00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 216:26:50,933.3329999446869
"I hope we reach the Western Paradise soon," said the Tang Monk.

2
216:28:30,933.3329999446869 --> 301:48:30,933.3329999446869
"This journey has been very dangerous."

3
301:50:10,933.3329999446869 --> 339:48:30,933.3329999446869
[g@Bajie nodded.

4
339:50:10,933.3329999446869 --> 469:25:10,933.3329999446869
"Those three demons tried to pickle me!"@g]

5
469:26:50,933.3329999446869 --> 562:21:50,933.3329999446869
Everybody laughed, even Bajie.

6
562:23:30,933.3329999446869 --> 685:35:10,933.3330001831055
"Wukong, what happened to those demons?" asked Wujing.

7
685:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 761:51:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Buddha took them away," said Wukong.

8
761:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 836:06:50,933.3330001831055
"I'm sure they were punished."@g]

9
836:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 941:50:10,933.3330001831055
"Thank you again for saving us," said the Tang Monk.

10
941:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 993:58:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong waved his hand.

11
994:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1062:23:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"It was nothing, Master.

12
1062:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1187:56:50,933.3330001831055
Buddha did most of the work."@g]

13
1187:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1334:20:10,933.3330001831055
The group felt a strong wind blow down from the mountains up ahead.

14
1334:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1453:08:30,933.3330001831055
A dark fog filled the sky and then disappeared.

15
1453:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1517:25:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk was nervous.

16
1517:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1636:38:30,933.3330001831055
"Wh-what caused that wind and fog?"@g]

17
1636:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1731:58:30,933.3330001831055
"Relax, Master," said Wukong.

18
1732:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1846:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"I'm sure it was something harmlessâ€”maybe [n@some small demons.

19
1846:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1989:56:50,933.3330001831055
I'll go check."@g]

20
1989:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2120:30:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey walked up the road and around a bend.

21
2120:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2200:28:30,933.3330001831055
He heard laughter and looked up.

22
2200:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2352:48:30,933.3330001831055
High above the road, a fat monster was sitting on the edge of a cliff.

23
2352:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2459:18:30,933.3330001831055
Several little demons sat next to the monster.

24
2459:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2562:56:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong flew up to get a closer look.

25
2562:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2658:36:50,933.3330001831055
The fat monster appeared to be concentrating.

26
2658:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2899:40:10,933.3330001831055
Suddenly . . . "Braap!" A burp as loud as thunder blew down the mountain.

27
2899:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3019:51:50,933.3330001831055
The demons giggled and laughed.

28
3019:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3108:56:50,933.3330001831055
"That was your best burp yet!" cried one demon.

29
3108:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3164:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The monster patted his belly.

30
3164:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3261:43:30,933.3330001831055
"Yes, I'm proud of that one."@g]

31
3261:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3350:36:50,933.3330001831055
"Show us the fog again!" said another demon.

32
3350:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3457:08:30,933.3330001831055
"Coming right up!" said the monster.

33
3457:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3643:10:10,933.3330001831055
He covered one nostril with a finger, closed his eyes, and blew hard.

34
3643:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3832:55:10,933.3330001831055
Dark fog poured out of his other nostril.

35
3832:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3914:51:50,933.3330001831055
The demons clapped and cheered.

36
3914:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3979:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The monster smiled and then . . .

37
3979:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4138:21:50,933.3330001831055
"Braap!" More wind blew down the mountain.@g]

38
4138:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4238:00:10,933.3330001831055
[g@There was a roar of laughter.

39
4238:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4374:08:30,933.3330001831055
One demon nearly fell off the cliff.@g]

40
4374:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4436:38:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong shook his head.

41
4436:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4557:58:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm not worried about these demons," he said to himself.

42
4558:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4691:28:30,933.3330001831055
"They're disgusting but not dangerous."

43
4691:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4729:45:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The monkey smiled.

44
4729:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4845:11:50,933.3330001831055
"It does give me an idea though . . ."@g]

45
4845:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4978:21:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong returned to his companions, who were waiting alongside the road.

46
4978:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5071:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Did you see any demons?" asked Wujing.

47
5071:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5115:53:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong shook his head.

48
5115:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5159:26:50,933.3330001831055
"The road is safe."@g]

49
5159:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5274:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Then the monkey pulled Bajie aside.

50
5274:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5338:43:30,933.3330001831055
"Bajie," he whispered.@g]

51
5338:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5382:21:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"There's a village up ahead.

52
5382:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5474:16:50,933.3330001831055
The people there are preparing a huge feast.@g]

53
5474:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5642:55:10,933.3330001831055
I saw vegetables, noodles, tofu, steamed buns, [n@and all sorts of delicious food.

54
5642:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5750:55:10,933.3330001831055
I thought maybe you'd like to go before us and start eating."

55
5750:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5809:23:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie licked his lips.

56
5809:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5875:36:50,933.3330001831055
"Thank you for thinking of me, Wukong.@g]

57
5875:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5954:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@I am rather hungry right now."

58
5954:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6057:46:50,933.3330001831055
The pig turned to the Tang Monk.@g]

59
6057:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6182:35:10,933.3330001831055
"Master, I think I should go ahead and check the mountain too.

60
6182:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6254:21:50,933.3330001831055
I trust Wukong, of course.

61
6254:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6383:20:10,933.3330001831055
But we must protect you, and I'd like to be extra safe."

62
6383:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6433:56:50,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk smiled.

63
6433:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6483:30:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"I'm impressed, Bajie.

6483:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6549:20:10,933.3330001831055
Thank you for doing extra work."@g]

6549:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6734:36:50,933.3330001831055
Bajie winked at Wukong and then headed up the road.

66
6734:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6870:45:10,933.3330001831055
"Braap!" The monster burped again, and another wind blew.

67
6870:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7074:03:30,933.3330001831055
Then he blew more fog from one nostril.

68
7074:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7197:45:10,933.3330001831055
The demons laughed hysterically.

69
7197:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7345:38:30,933.3330001831055
Suddenly there was a loud rumbling sound, and everyone was silent.

70
7345:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7415:01:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The monster patted his big belly.

71
7415:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7511:05:10,933.3330001831055
"I'm hungry."@g]

72
7511:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7584:11:50,933.3330001831055
The demons looked at one another.

73
7584:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7657:36:50,933.3330001831055
"I'm hungry too," said one.

74
7657:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7772:58:30,933.3330001831055
"It's probably time for lunch," said another.

75
7773:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7822:56:50,933.3330001831055
The monster stood up.

76
7822:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7947:40:10,933.3330001831055
"Let's go down to the road and find some people to eat!"

77
7947:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8102:50:10,933.3330001831055
The demons cheered and followed the monster down the mountain.

78
8102:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8239:48:30,933.3330001831055
When they got to the road, they made themselves look like people.

79
8239:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8336:36:50,933.3330001831055
The monster chuckled.

80
8336:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8496:51:50,933.3330001831055
"The next time someone comes along this road, it's lunchtime!"

81
8496:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8602:00:10,933.3330001831055
[g@For a few moments, they waited.

8602:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8717:33:30,933.3330001831055

8717:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8815:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Hello!" said Bajie, smiling.

8815:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8995:30:10,933.3330001831055
"I'm here for the feast!"@g]
