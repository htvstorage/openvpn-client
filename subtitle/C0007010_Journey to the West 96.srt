1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:18,725
"I hope we reach the Western Paradise soon," said the Tang Monk.

2
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:21,798
"This journey has been very dangerous."

3
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:23,166
Bajie nodded.

4
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:27,832
"Those three demons tried to pickle me!"

5
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:31,178
Everybody laughed, even Bajie.

6
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:35,614
"Wukong, what happened to those demons?" asked Wujing.

7
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:38,360
"Buddha took them away," said Wukong.

8
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:41,033
"I'm sure they were punished."

9
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:44,839
"Thank you again for saving us," said the Tang Monk.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,716
Wukong waved his hand.

11
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:49,179
"It was nothing, Master.

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,699
Buddha did most of the work."

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,969
The group felt a strong wind blow down from the mountains up ahead.

14
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,246
A dark fog filled the sky and then disappeared.

15
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:05,560
The Tang Monk was nervous.

16
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:09,852
"Wh-what caused that wind and fog?"

17
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:13,284
"Relax, Master," said Wukong.

18
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:17,417
"I'm sure it was something harmlessâ€”maybe some small demons.

19
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:22,571
I'll go check."

20
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:27,271
The monkey walked up the road and around a bend.

21
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:30,150
He heard laughter and looked up.

22
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:35,634
High above the road, a fat monster was sitting on the edge of a cliff.

23
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:39,468
Several little demons sat next to the monster.

24
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:43,199
Wukong flew up to get a closer look.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,643
The fat monster appeared to be concentrating.

26
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:55,321
Suddenly . . . "Braap!" A burp as loud as thunder blew down the mountain.

27
00:01:55,322 --> 00:01:59,648
The demons giggled and laughed.

28
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:02,855
"That was your best burp yet!" cried one demon.

29
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,841
The monster patted his belly.

30
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:08,355
"Yes, I'm proud of that one."

31
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:11,555
"Show us the fog again!" said another demon.

32
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:15,390
"Coming right up!" said the monster.

33
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:22,087
He covered one nostril with a finger, closed his eyes, and blew hard.

34
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:28,918
Dark fog poured out of his other nostril.

35
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,868
The demons clapped and cheered.

36
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:34,189
The monster smiled and then . . .

37
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:39,914
"Braap!" More wind blew down the mountain.

38
00:02:39,915 --> 00:02:43,501
There was a roar of laughter.

39
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:48,402
One demon nearly fell off the cliff.

40
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:50,652
Wukong shook his head.

41
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:55,020
"I'm not worried about these demons," he said to himself.

42
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:59,826
"They're disgusting but not dangerous."

43
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:01,204
The monkey smiled.

44
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:05,360
"It does give me an idea though . . ."

45
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:10,154
Wukong returned to his companions, who were waiting alongside the road.

46
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:13,517
"Did you see any demons?" asked Wujing.

47
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:15,105
Wukong shook his head.

48
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:16,673
"The road is safe."

49
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:20,803
Then the monkey pulled Bajie aside.

50
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:23,127
"Bajie," he whispered.

51
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:24,698
"There's a village up ahead.

52
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,007
The people there are preparing a huge feast.

53
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:34,078
I saw vegetables, noodles, tofu, steamed buns, and all sorts of delicious food.

54
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,966
I thought maybe you'd like to go before us and start eating."

55
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,071
Bajie licked his lips.

56
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:42,455
"Thank you for thinking of me, Wukong.

57
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,299
I am rather hungry right now."

58
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,013
The pig turned to the Tang Monk.

59
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:53,506
"Master, I think I should go ahead and check the mountain too.

60
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:56,090
I trust Wukong, of course.

61
00:03:56,091 --> 00:04:00,733
But we must protect you, and I'd like to be extra safe."

62
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:02,555
The Tang Monk smiled.

63
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:04,339
"I'm impressed, Bajie.

64
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,709
Thank you for doing extra work."

65
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:13,379
Bajie winked at Wukong and then headed up the road.

66
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,280
"Braap!" The monster burped again, and another wind blew.

67
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:25,599
Then he blew more fog from one nostril.

68
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,052
The demons laughed hysterically.

69
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:35,376
Suddenly there was a loud rumbling sound, and everyone was silent.

70
00:04:35,377 --> 00:04:37,874
The monster patted his big belly.

71
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:41,332
"I'm hungry."

72
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,964
The demons looked at one another.

73
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:46,607
"I'm hungry too," said one.

74
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:50,760
"It's probably time for lunch," said another.

75
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:52,559
The monster stood up.

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,049
"Let's go down to the road and find some people to eat!"

77
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,635
The demons cheered and followed the monster down the mountain.

78
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:07,566
When they got to the road, they made themselves look like people.

79
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:11,051
The monster chuckled.

80
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:16,820
"The next time someone comes along this road, it's lunchtime!"

81
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:20,605
For a few moments, they waited.

82
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:24,765
Then a large pig came around the bend.

83
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:28,279
"Hello!" said Bajie, smiling.

84
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,771
"I'm here for the feast!"
