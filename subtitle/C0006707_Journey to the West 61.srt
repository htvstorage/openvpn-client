1
00:00:11,000 --> 115:56:51,000
Wukong leaped into the air.

2
115:58:31,000 --> 310:03:31,000
His three companions and the horse fell into the water with a splash.

3
310:05:11,000 --> 416:18:31,000
Bajie climbed back out, coughing.

4
416:20:11,000 --> 582:41:51,000
Wujing came up next, pulling the horse behind him.

5
582:43:31,000 --> 679:25:11,000
"Where's the Tang Monk?" cried Wukong.

6
679:26:51,000 --> 856:06:51,000
Below the ice the Tang Monk struggled as the [n@demon carried him deep underwater.

7
856:08:31,000 --> 914:41:51,000
[g@The demon laughed.

8
914:43:31,000 --> 983:11:51,000
"You all fell for my trick!@g]

9
983:13:31,000 --> 1111:05:11,000
I froze the river and waited for you to cross it.

10
1111:06:51,000 --> 1224:38:31,000
Once you were above me, I cracked the ice open.

11
1224:40:11,000 --> 1390:38:31,000
As soon as your friends leave, I will eat you and live forever!"

12
1390:40:11,000 --> 1446:26:51,000
They arrived at a palace.

13
1446:28:31,000 --> 1577:53:31,000
A sign over the door read "Residence of the River Turtle."

14
1577:55:11,000 --> 1739:33:31,000
The demon went inside and locked the monk in a stone box.

15
1739:35:11,000 --> 1869:45:11,000
Up on the ice, Wukong paced back and forth.

16
1869:46:51,000 --> 1977:20:11,000
"The ice didn't crack by accident," said the monkey.

17
1977:21:51,000 --> 2051:25:11,000
"I'm sure it was the demon.

18
2051:26:51,000 --> 2189:06:51,000
[g@The demon probably caused this strange cold weather too."

19
2189:08:31,000 --> 2235:41:51,000
He made a fist.@g]

20
2235:43:31,000 --> 2309:56:51,000
[g@"I can't believe we fell for his trick!

21
2309:58:31,000 --> 2396:43:31,000
We must save the Tang Monk!"@g]

22
2396:45:11,000 --> 2508:40:11,000
Wukong stopped pacing and looked at his companions.

23
2508:41:51,000 --> 2590:15:11,000
"My powers aren't very strong underwater.

24
2590:16:51,000 --> 2696:36:51,000
You two must go down there and get the demon to come back up.

25
2696:38:31,000 --> 2763:08:31,000
I'll surprise him."

26
2763:10:11,000 --> 2896:30:11,000
Wujing and Bajie nodded and dived into the river.

27
2896:31:51,000 --> 3062:01:51,000
They soon spotted a palace.

28
3062:03:31,000 --> 3130:06:51,000
Wujing read the sign over the door:

29
3130:08:31,000 --> 3186:31:51,000
[g@"'Residence of the River Turtle.'

30
3186:33:31,000 --> 3254:58:31,000
I wonder if the demon is in here."@g]

31
3255:00:11,000 --> 3318:38:31,000
[g@Bajie knocked on the door.

32
3318:40:11,000 --> 3403:06:51,000
"Open up!" he shouted.@g]

33
3403:08:31,000 --> 3519:06:51,000
[g@The door opened, and the demon stepped out.

34
3519:08:31,000 --> 3602:35:11,000
He was holding a large hammer.@g]

35
3602:36:51,000 --> 3690:15:11,000
"What do you want?" he asked.

36
3690:16:51,000 --> 3777:23:31,000
"Did you kidnap our master?" asked Wujing.

37
3777:25:11,000 --> 3900:53:31,000
[g@"Yes," said the demon. "And I plan to eat him.

38
3900:55:11,000 --> 4022:50:11,000
Now go away!"@g]

39
4022:51:51,000 --> 4169:38:31,000
The demon tried to close the door, but Wujing [n@stopped the door with his spear.

40
4169:40:11,000 --> 4242:23:31,000
[g@The demon moved toward him.

41
4242:25:11,000 --> 4318:06:51,000
Bajie's rake came crashing down.@g]

42
4318:08:31,000 --> 4455:00:11,000
[i@Clang!@i] The demon blocked the rake with his hammer.

43
4455:01:51,000 --> 4571:35:11,000
Fish and other creatures fled as the three spirits fought.

44
4571:36:51,000 --> 4675:53:31,000
After a few minutes, Bajie pretended to be scared.

45
4675:55:11,000 --> 4820:30:11,000
He swam upward, and Wujing soon followed.

46
4820:31:51,000 --> 4966:43:31,000
"Cowards!" called the demon, swimming after them toward the surface.

47
4966:45:11,000 --> 5154:16:51,000
The demon jumped out of the water and onto the ice.

48
5154:18:31,000 --> 5239:53:31,000
[g@Wukong was waiting for him.

49
5239:55:11,000 --> 5346:03:31,000
The monkey swung his iron bar.@g]

50
5346:05:11,000 --> 5381:56:51,000
[g@The demon ducked.

51
5381:58:31,000 --> 5496:36:51,000
[i@Crack!@i] The bar hit the ice.@g]

52
5496:38:31,000 --> 5589:43:31,000
[g@The demon swung his hammer.

53
5589:45:11,000 --> 5698:48:31,000
[i@Bam!@i] More cracks formed in the ice.@g]

54
5698:50:11,000 --> 5759:28:31,000
[i@Clang! Boom! Crash!@i]

55
5759:30:11,000 --> 5862:18:31,000
Weapons clashed as the spirits fought on the breaking ice.

56
5862:20:11,000 --> 5946:56:51,000
The demon hit Bajie's legs.

57
5946:58:31,000 --> 6009:06:51,000
[g@"Whoa!" cried the pig.

58
6009:08:31,000 --> 6111:35:11,000
He slid across the ice and slammed into Wujing.@g]

59
6111:36:51,000 --> 6196:51:51,000
"Oof!" The purple spirit slipped and fell.

60
6196:53:31,000 --> 6306:38:31,000
"Ha!" The demon laughed and dived back under the ice.

61
6306:40:11,000 --> 6397:28:31,000
Bajie and Wujing stood back up.

62
6397:30:11,000 --> 6475:46:51,000
"The demon escaped," said the pig.

63
6475:48:31,000 --> 6587:56:51,000
"We must stop him before he eats the Tang Monk," said Wukong.

64
6587:58:31,000 --> 6709:46:51,000
"Go back down there and try to lead him up here again."

65
6709:48:31,000 --> 6833:53:31,000
Wujing and Bajie dived into the river.

66
6833:55:11,000 --> 6979:06:51,000
When they reached the palace, they found a huge [n@pile of rocks blocking the door.

67
6979:08:31,000 --> 7064:01:51,000
[g@Bajie struck the rocks with his rake.

68
7064:03:31,000 --> 7137:13:31,000
The rake bounced off the rock pile.@g]

69
7137:15:11,000 --> 7196:08:31,000
[g@The rocks didn't move at all.

70
7196:10:11,000 --> 7278:28:31,000
Wujing stabbed at the rocks with his spear.@g]

71
7278:30:11,000 --> 7367:31:51,000
Again, the rocks didn't move.

72
7367:33:31,000 --> 7484:23:31,000
"What kind of rocks are these?" cried the pig.

73
7484:25:11,000 --> 7597:18:31,000
"Maybe they're held in place with magic," said Wujing.

74
7597:20:11,000 --> 7735:01:51,000
They returned to the surface of the river and told Wukong about the rocks.

75
7735:03:31,000 --> 7790:13:31,000
[g@The monkey sighed.

76
7790:15:11,000 --> 7982:16:51,000
"We need Guanyin's help."@g]
