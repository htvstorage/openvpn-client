1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,174
Wukong leaped into the air.

2
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:22,162
His three companions and the horse fell into the water with a splash.

3
00:00:22,163 --> 00:00:25,987
Bajie climbed back out, coughing.

4
00:00:25,988 --> 00:00:31,977
Wujing came up next, pulling the horse behind him.

5
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:35,459
"Where's the Tang Monk?" cried Wukong.

6
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,820
Below the ice the Tang Monk struggled as the [n@demon carried him deep underwater.

7
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,929
[g@The demon laughed.

8
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,395
"You all fell for my trick!@g]

9
00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:50,999
I froze the river and waited for you to cross it.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,087
Once you were above me, I cracked the ice open.

11
00:00:55,088 --> 00:01:01,063
As soon as your friends leave, I will eat you and live forever!"

12
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:03,072
They arrived at a palace.

13
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:07,804
A sign over the door read "Residence of the River Turtle."

14
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:13,624
The demon went inside and locked the monk in a stone box.

15
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:18,311
Up on the ice, Wukong paced back and forth.

16
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:22,184
"The ice didn't crack by accident," said the monkey.

17
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:24,851
"I'm sure it was the demon.

18
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:29,808
[g@The demon probably caused this strange cold weather too."

19
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:31,485
He made a fist.@g]

20
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:34,158
[g@"I can't believe we fell for his trick!

21
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,282
We must save the Tang Monk!"@g]

22
00:01:37,283 --> 00:01:41,312
Wukong stopped pacing and looked at his companions.

23
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:44,249
"My powers aren't very strong underwater.

24
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,078
You two must go down there and get the demon to come back up.

25
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,473
I'll surprise him."

26
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:55,274
Wujing and Bajie nodded and dived into the river.

27
00:01:55,275 --> 00:02:01,233
They soon spotted a palace.

28
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:03,684
Wujing read the sign over the door:

29
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:05,715
[g@"'Residence of the River Turtle.'

30
00:02:05,716 --> 00:02:08,179
I wonder if the demon is in here."@g]

31
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,471
[g@Bajie knocked on the door.

32
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:13,512
"Open up!" he shouted.@g]

33
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:17,688
[g@The door opened, and the demon stepped out.

34
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:20,693
He was holding a large hammer.@g]

35
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:23,849
"What do you want?" he asked.

36
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,986
"Did you kidnap our master?" asked Wujing.

37
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:31,432
[g@"Yes," said the demon. "And I plan to eat him.

38
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:35,822
Now go away!"@g]

39
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:41,107
The demon tried to close the door, but Wujing [n@stopped the door with his spear.

40
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:43,726
[g@The demon moved toward him.

41
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:46,452
Bajie's rake came crashing down.@g]

42
00:02:46,453 --> 00:02:51,380
[i@Clang!@i] The demon blocked the rake with his hammer.

43
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:55,577
Fish and other creatures fled as the three spirits fought.

44
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:59,332
After a few minutes, Bajie pretended to be scared.

45
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:04,538
He swam upward, and Wujing soon followed.

46
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:09,802
"Cowards!" called the demon, swimming after them toward the surface.

47
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:16,554
The demon jumped out of the water and onto the ice.

48
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:19,636
[g@Wukong was waiting for him.

49
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:23,458
The monkey swung his iron bar.@g]

50
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:24,750
[g@The demon ducked.

51
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:28,878
[i@Crack!@i] The bar hit the ice.@g]

52
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,230
[g@The demon swung his hammer.

53
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:36,157
[i@Bam!@i] More cracks formed in the ice.@g]

54
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:38,341
[i@Clang! Boom! Crash!@i]

55
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:42,043
Weapons clashed as the spirits fought on the breaking ice.

56
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:45,090
The demon hit Bajie's legs.

57
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,328
[g@"Whoa!" cried the pig.

58
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:51,017
He slid across the ice and slammed into Wujing.@g]

59
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:54,087
"Oof!" The purple spirit slipped and fell.

60
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:58,039
"Ha!" The demon laughed and dived back under the ice.

61
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,309
Bajie and Wujing stood back up.

62
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,128
"The demon escaped," said the pig.

63
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:08,166
"We must stop him before he eats the Tang Monk," said Wukong.

64
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:12,552
"Go back down there and try to lead him up here again."

65
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:17,020
Wujing and Bajie dived into the river.

66
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:22,248
When they reached the palace, they found a huge [n@pile of rocks blocking the door.

67
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:25,305
[g@Bajie struck the rocks with his rake.

68
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,940
The rake bounced off the rock pile.@g]

69
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:30,061
[g@The rocks didn't move at all.

70
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:33,025
Wujing stabbed at the rocks with his spear.@g]

71
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:36,231
Again, the rocks didn't move.

72
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:40,438
"What kind of rocks are these?" cried the pig.

73
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,503
"Maybe they're held in place with magic," said Wujing.

74
00:04:44,504 --> 00:04:49,461
They returned to the surface of the river and told Wukong about the rocks.

75
00:04:49,462 --> 00:04:51,448
[g@The monkey sighed.

76
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:58,362
"We need Guanyin's help."@g]
