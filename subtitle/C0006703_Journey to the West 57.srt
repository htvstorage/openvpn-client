1
00:00:11,000 --> 161:36:51,000
"Don't make any rain yet," Wukong repeated.

2
161:38:31,000 --> 283:28:31,000
"But we must," said the Old Woman of the Wind.

3
283:30:11,000 --> 406:21:51,000
"Someone on Earth just prayed for it."

4
406:23:31,000 --> 587:38:31,000
"And the Jade Emperor heard the prayers," added [n@the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea.

5
587:40:11,000 --> 707:43:31,000
"The person who recited the prayers is bad," said Wukong.

6
707:45:11,000 --> 849:20:11,000
"He's the Tiger Immortal, and he plans to make the Tang Monk a slave."

7
849:21:51,000 --> 925:05:11,000
The Dragon King looked concerned.

8
925:06:51,000 --> 1111:10:11,000
"That's terrible. We all want the Tang Monk to reach the Western Paradise."

9
1111:11:51,000 --> 1295:41:51,000
"But we must obey the Jade Emperor's orders," said the woman.

10
1295:43:31,000 --> 1380:35:11,000
"Just wait a moment," said the monkey.

11
1380:36:51,000 --> 1442:35:11,000
"I'll go back down to the ground now.

12
1442:36:51,000 --> 1544:00:11,000
When I raise my iron bar, you can make it rain."

13
1544:01:51,000 --> 1695:46:51,000
The woman and the Dragon King agreed to wait a moment.

14
1695:48:31,000 --> 1797:53:31,000
Wukong returned to his body.

15
1797:55:11,000 --> 1918:33:31,000
The sky cleared, and the Tiger Immortal shook with anger.

16
1918:35:11,000 --> 2026:31:51,000
"Why didn't my spell work?" he cried.

17
2026:33:31,000 --> 2117:10:11,000
[g@Bajie laughed at him.

18
2117:11:51,000 --> 2230:13:31,000
"Some rain! You couldn't even summon one drop!"@g]

19
2230:15:11,000 --> 2342:18:31,000
"I'll try again," said the Tiger Immortal.

20
2342:20:11,000 --> 2421:51:51,000
"No, you won't," said Wukong.

21
2421:53:31,000 --> 2524:15:11,000
"You had a chance to summon rain, and you obviously can't.

22
2524:16:51,000 --> 2576:36:51,000
Now it's my turn."

23
2576:38:31,000 --> 2678:11:51,000
The monkey raised his iron bar into the air.

24
2678:13:31,000 --> 2814:25:11,000
Instantly clouds moved back in, and thunder boomed.

25
2814:26:51,000 --> 2880:06:51,000
[g@Rain began to pour down.

26
2880:08:31,000 --> 2978:05:11,000
The crowd cheered.@g]

27
2978:06:51,000 --> 3051:11:51,000
[g@The Tang Monk sighed.

28
3051:13:31,000 --> 3170:33:31,000
"Wonderful! Now all the Buddhist monks will be free.@g]

29
3170:35:11,000 --> 3246:06:51,000
And we can continue our journey."

30
3246:08:31,000 --> 3354:18:31,000
[g@The Tiger Immortal stomped over to Wukong.

31
3354:20:11,000 --> 3435:35:11,000
"I want another contest!"@g]

32
3435:36:51,000 --> 3570:43:31,000
Wukong laughed. "Why would you want another contest?

33
3570:45:11,000 --> 3631:13:31,000
You'll only lose again."

34
3631:15:11,000 --> 3726:56:51,000
The Tiger Immortal ignored the monkey's question.

35
3726:58:31,000 --> 3842:13:31,000
"I challenge the Tang Monk to a guessing game."

36
3842:15:11,000 --> 3969:53:31,000
The Tang Monk's mouth fell open. "Butâ€”"

37
3969:55:11,000 --> 4079:20:11,000
"We accept your challenge," said the monkey with a smile.

38
4079:21:51,000 --> 4154:08:31,000
"Good," said the Tiger Immortal.

39
4154:10:11,000 --> 4208:38:31,000
[g@"I will be right back."

40
4208:40:11,000 --> 4318:45:11,000
He walked away.@g]

41
4318:46:51,000 --> 4443:26:51,000
"Wukong, why did you agree to this contest?" asked the Tang Monk.

42
4443:28:31,000 --> 4496:38:31,000
"I won't win."

43
4496:40:11,000 --> 4572:55:11,000
[g@"Don't worry, Master," said the monkey.

44
4572:56:51,000 --> 4694:15:11,000
"I'll help you."@g]

45
4694:16:51,000 --> 4822:21:51,000
The Tiger Immortal soon came back with a small box.

46
4822:23:31,000 --> 4966:46:51,000
"If you can guess what's in this box, I will let you all go free."

47
4966:48:31,000 --> 5100:03:31,000
As the Tang Monk stared at the box, Wukong plucked a hair.

48
5100:05:11,000 --> 5238:01:51,000
Using his magic, he made the hair look like himself.

49
5238:03:31,000 --> 5373:35:11,000
Then he made himself tiny and squeezed through a crack in the box.

50
5373:36:51,000 --> 5456:38:31,000
Inside the box was a ripe peach.

51
5456:40:11,000 --> 5616:28:31,000
Quickly he ate the peach, leaving only the pit.

52
5616:30:11,000 --> 5727:18:31,000
A moment later he was standing next to the Tang Monk again.

53
5727:20:11,000 --> 5866:48:31,000
Wukong leaned toward the monk and whispered, "It's a peach pit."

54
5866:50:11,000 --> 5939:55:11,000
[g@"Are you sure?" whispered the monk.

55
5939:56:51,000 --> 5986:01:51,000
"How do you know?"@g]

56
5986:03:31,000 --> 6095:36:51,000
"Stop talking to each other!" said the Tiger Immortal.

57
6095:38:31,000 --> 6165:26:51,000
"What's in the box?"

58
6165:28:31,000 --> 6296:56:51,000
"I think it's a peach pit," said the monk nervously.

59
6296:58:31,000 --> 6416:16:51,000
"Ha!" said the Tiger Immortal. "You're wrong, Monk.

60
6416:18:31,000 --> 6471:33:31,000
[g@It's not just a peach pit.

61
6471:35:11,000 --> 6539:40:11,000
It's a whole peach.

62
6539:41:51,000 --> 6603:00:11,000
I'll show you."@g]

63
6603:01:51,000 --> 6763:46:51,000
The Tiger Immortal opened the box and showed it to everyone. "See?"

64
6763:48:31,000 --> 6825:10:11,000
[g@The Tang Monk smiled.

65
6825:11:51,000 --> 6863:20:11,000
"I was right!

66
6863:21:51,000 --> 6930:56:51,000
It [i@is@i] a peach pit."@g]

67
6930:58:31,000 --> 6998:45:11,000
"What?" cried the Tiger Immortal.

68
6998:46:51,000 --> 7072:31:51,000
[g@He looked in the box and gasped.

69
7072:33:31,000 --> 7145:23:31,000
"Who ate the peach?"@g]

70
7145:25:11,000 --> 7288:13:31,000
Wukong laughed. "The Tang Monk guessed correctly!"

71
7288:15:11,000 --> 7382:23:31,000
"I guess we can leave now," said Wujing.

72
7382:25:11,000 --> 7508:58:31,000
"Yes, but we should eat some dinner first," said Bajie.

73
7509:00:11,000 --> 7621:58:31,000
"All this talk about peaches has made me hungry."

74
7622:00:11,000 --> 7695:41:51,000
Wukong looked at the Tiger Immortal.

75
7695:43:31,000 --> 7810:58:31,000
"You will set the Buddhist monks free now, right?"

76
7811:00:11,000 --> 7901:26:51,000
The Tiger Immortal glared at the monkey.

77
7901:28:31,000 --> 8160:13:31,000
"I challenge you to another contest!"
