1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,818
"Don't make any rain yet," Wukong repeated.

2
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:21,205
"But we must," said the Old Woman of the Wind.

3
00:00:21,206 --> 00:00:25,629
"Someone on Earth just prayed for it."

4
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:32,155
"And the Jade Emperor heard the prayers," added [n@the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea.

5
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:36,478
"The person who recited the prayers is bad," said Wukong.

6
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,576
"He's the Tiger Immortal, and he plans to make the Tang Monk a slave."

7
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:44,303
The Dragon King looked concerned.

8
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:51,002
"That's terrible. We all want the Tang Monk to reach the Western Paradise."

9
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:57,645
"But we must obey the Jade Emperor's orders," said the woman.

10
00:00:57,646 --> 00:01:00,701
"Just wait a moment," said the monkey.

11
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:02,933
"I'll go back down to the ground now.

12
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:06,584
When I raise my iron bar, you can make it rain."

13
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:12,048
The woman and the Dragon King agreed to wait a moment.

14
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,724
Wukong returned to his body.

15
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:20,068
The sky cleared, and the Tiger Immortal shook with anger.

16
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:23,955
"Why didn't my spell work?" he cried.

17
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:27,218
[g@Bajie laughed at him.

18
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:31,288
"Some rain! You couldn't even summon one drop!"@g]

19
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:35,323
"I'll try again," said the Tiger Immortal.

20
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:38,187
"No, you won't," said Wukong.

21
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:41,873
"You had a chance to summon rain, and you obviously can't.

22
00:01:41,874 --> 00:01:43,758
Now it's my turn."

23
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,415
The monkey raised his iron bar into the air.

24
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:52,319
Instantly clouds moved back in, and thunder boomed.

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,684
[g@Rain began to pour down.

26
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:58,211
The crowd cheered.@g]

27
00:01:58,212 --> 00:02:00,843
[g@The Tang Monk sighed.

28
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:05,140
"Wonderful! Now all the Buddhist monks will be free.@g]

29
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:07,860
And we can continue our journey."

30
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,755
[g@The Tiger Immortal stomped over to Wukong.

31
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,681
"I want another contest!"@g]

32
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:19,546
Wukong laughed. "Why would you want another contest?

33
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:21,724
You'll only lose again."

34
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:25,170
The Tiger Immortal ignored the monkey's question.

35
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:29,320
"I challenge the Tang Monk to a guessing game."

36
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:33,916
The Tang Monk's mouth fell open. "Butâ€”"

37
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:37,856
"We accept your challenge," said the monkey with a smile.

38
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,549
"Good," said the Tiger Immortal.

39
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,511
[g@"I will be right back."

40
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:46,475
He walked away.@g]

41
00:02:46,476 --> 00:02:50,964
"Wukong, why did you agree to this contest?" asked the Tang Monk.

42
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:52,879
"I won't win."

43
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,625
[g@"Don't worry, Master," said the monkey.

44
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:59,993
"I'll help you."@g]

45
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:04,605
The Tiger Immortal soon came back with a small box.

46
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:09,804
"If you can guess what's in this box, I will let you all go free."

47
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:14,602
As the Tang Monk stared at the box, Wukong plucked a hair.

48
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:19,569
Using his magic, he made the hair look like himself.

49
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,449
Then he made himself tiny and squeezed through a crack in the box.

50
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,439
Inside the box was a ripe peach.

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,193
Quickly he ate the peach, leaving only the pit.

52
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:37,183
A moment later he was standing next to the Tang Monk again.

53
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:42,205
Wukong leaned toward the monk and whispered, "It's a peach pit."

54
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:44,837
[g@"Are you sure?" whispered the monk.

55
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:46,497
"How do you know?"@g]

56
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:50,442
"Stop talking to each other!" said the Tiger Immortal.

57
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:52,956
"What's in the box?"

58
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:57,690
"I think it's a peach pit," said the monk nervously.

59
00:03:57,691 --> 00:04:01,986
"Ha!" said the Tiger Immortal. "You're wrong, Monk.

60
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:03,976
[g@It's not just a peach pit.

61
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,428
It's a whole peach.

62
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,708
I'll show you."@g]

63
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:14,496
The Tiger Immortal opened the box and showed it to everyone. "See?"

64
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:16,706
[g@The Tang Monk smiled.

65
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:18,080
"I was right!

66
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:20,514
It [i@is@i] a peach pit."@g]

67
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:22,955
"What?" cried the Tiger Immortal.

68
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:25,611
[g@He looked in the box and gasped.

69
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:28,234
"Who ate the peach?"@g]

70
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:33,376
Wukong laughed. "The Tang Monk guessed correctly!"

71
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:36,766
"I guess we can leave now," said Wujing.

72
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:41,323
"Yes, but we should eat some dinner first," said Bajie.

73
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:45,391
"All this talk about peaches has made me hungry."

74
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:48,045
Wukong looked at the Tiger Immortal.

75
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:52,195
"You will set the Buddhist monks free now, right?"

76
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:55,452
The Tiger Immortal glared at the monkey.

77
00:04:55,453 --> 00:05:04,768
"I challenge you to another contest!"
