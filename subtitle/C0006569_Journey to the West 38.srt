Time passed, and it was soon spring.

143:08:31,266.66699999570847 --> 356:23:31,266.6670000553131
The air grew warm, flowers bloomed, and birds swooped from tree to tree.

3
356:25:11,266.6670000553131 --> 523:31:51,266.6670000553131
The road Wukong and the others were traveling began to go up a mountain.

523:33:31,266.6670000553131 --> 588:16:51,266.6670000553131

"Bajie, go up the road and search the mountain.@g]

666:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 774:40:11,266.66699981689453
There might be a demon up there, and I don't want Master to get hurt."

774:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 844:36:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"Ugh," moaned the pig.

934:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1052:25:11,266.66699981689453
Dragging his feet, he headed up the mountain road.

10
1052:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1144:23:31,266.66699981689453
[g@Wukong turned to the Tang Monk and Wujing.

1144:25:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1196:01:51,266.66699981689453

I want to make sure he really searches the mountain."

13
1330:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1602:16:51,266.66699981689453
The monkey turned invisible and followed Bajie up the road.

14
1602:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1688:48:31,266.66699981689453
The pig walked for a few minutes.

15
1688:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1816:05:11,266.66699981689453
When he was sure his companions wouldn't hear him, he turned around.

16
1816:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1889:46:51,266.66699981689453
"You dummies!" shouted Bajie.

1889:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1955:28:31,266.66699981689453

1990:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2066:53:31,266.66699981689453
[g@I'm not going to search this mountain.

2066:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2149:41:51,266.66699981689453
I'm going to take a nap instead.@g]

2149:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2302:11:51,266.66699981689453
And when I come back, I'll lie and say I searched the mountain!"

22
2302:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2624:51:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Bajie found a big log.

2624:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2835:46:51,266.66699981689453
He lay down behind it and fell fast asleep.@g]

2835:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2929:43:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"This pig is so lazy," thought Wukong.

25
2929:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2981:35:11,266.66699981689453
"I'll teach him a lesson."@g]

2981:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3104:30:11,266.66699981689453
The monkey turned himself into a woodpecker and pecked the log.

27
3104:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3252:23:31,266.66699981689453

Bajie rolled over and mumbled.

29
3333:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3393:10:11,266.66699981689453
[g@Wukong pecked again.

3553:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3625:11:51,266.66699981689453
"Quit tapping, you annoying woodpecker!@g]

3946:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4074:08:31,266.66699981689453
"Ouch!" cried the pig, jumping to his feet.

38
4074:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4135:45:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong flew away.

4135:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4186:33:31,266.66699981689453

He sighed. "I guess I'll go back down."

42
4453:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4562:45:11,266.66699981689453
When Bajie found his companions, he lied.

43
4562:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4714:36:51,266.66699981689453
"I searched the entire mountain," he said. "It's safe."

4714:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4830:11:51,266.66699981689453
"Did you see any demons or monsters?" asked Wukong.

4830:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4911:35:11,266.66699981689453
Bajie shook his head.

5797:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6015:46:51,266.66699981689453
The pig headed back up the road.

6015:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6150:26:51,266.66699981689453
He had walked for a while when he saw a fox.

"I know that's you, Wukong!" he shouted.

6361:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6475:46:51,266.66699981689453
A robin flew past Bajie's head.

6475:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6578:00:11,266.66699981689453

6578:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6727:13:31,266.66699981689453
As he waved the rake at the bird, Bajie tripped and fell.
