1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:16,419
Time passed, and it was soon spring.

2
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:24,097
The air grew warm, flowers bloomed, and birds swooped from tree to tree.

3
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:30,114
The road Wukong and the others were traveling began to go up a mountain.

4
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:32,445
[g@Wukong stopped the group.

5
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:35,244
"Bajie, go up the road and search the mountain.@g]

6
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:39,155
There might be a demon up there, and I don't want Master to get hurt."

7
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:41,673
[g@"Ugh," moaned the pig.

8
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:44,898
"You make me do all the hard work."@g]

9
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,154
Dragging his feet, he headed up the mountain road.

10
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:52,465
[g@Wukong turned to the Tang Monk and Wujing.

11
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:54,324
"I'm going to follow the pig.@g]

12
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:59,156
I want to make sure he really searches the mountain."

13
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:08,949
The monkey turned invisible and followed Bajie up the road.

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,064
The pig walked for a few minutes.

15
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:16,646
When he was sure his companions wouldn't hear him, he turned around.

16
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:19,299
"You dummies!" shouted Bajie.

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,664
[g@"You make me do all the hard work!

18
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:22,910
Well, guess what?@g]

19
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:25,675
[g@I'm not going to search this mountain.

20
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:28,656
I'm going to take a nap instead.@g]

21
00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:34,146
And when I come back, I'll lie and say I searched the mountain!"

22
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:45,762
[g@Bajie found a big log.

23
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:53,355
He lay down behind it and fell fast asleep.@g]

24
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:56,737
[g@"This pig is so lazy," thought Wukong.

25
00:01:56,738 --> 00:01:58,604
"I'll teach him a lesson."@g]

26
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:03,029
The monkey turned himself into a woodpecker and pecked the log.

27
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,353
[i@Tap, tap, tap! Tap, tap, tap!@i]

28
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:11,284
Bajie rolled over and mumbled.

29
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:13,421
[g@Wukong pecked again.

30
00:02:13,422 --> 00:02:17,563
[i@Tap, tap, tap! Tap, tap, tap!@i]@g]

31
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:19,195
[g@The pig sat up.

32
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:21,774
"Quit tapping, you annoying woodpecker!@g]

33
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,358
[g@I'm trying to sleep!"

34
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:27,801
He fell asleep again.@g]

35
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:30,271
[g@Wukong landed on Bajie's head.

36
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,325
[i@Tap, tap, tap! Tap, tap, tap!@i]@g]

37
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:37,936
"Ouch!" cried the pig, jumping to his feet.

38
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:40,154
Wukong flew away.

39
00:02:40,155 --> 00:02:41,983
[g@Bajie rubbed his head.

40
00:02:41,984 --> 00:02:46,500
"I can't even take a nap!"@g]

41
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:51,594
He sighed. "I guess I'll go back down."

42
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:55,526
When Bajie found his companions, he lied.

43
00:02:55,527 --> 00:03:00,993
"I searched the entire mountain," he said. "It's safe."

44
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:05,154
"Did you see any demons or monsters?" asked Wukong.

45
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:08,084
Bajie shook his head.

46
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:11,891
[g@"How about woodpeckers?" asked the monkey.

47
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,347
"Did you see any of them?"@g]

48
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:16,264
[g@The pig looked surprised.

49
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:19,007
"What . . . how did you . . . ?"@g]

50
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:22,556
"That was me, Bajie!" shouted Wukong.

51
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:24,437
[g@"You took a nap!

52
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:27,760
You didn't search the mountain at all!"@g]

53
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,878
Bajie hung his head.

54
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,732
"You should be ashamed of yourself, Bajie," said Wujing.

55
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,180
[g@The Tang Monk frowned.

56
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:39,980
"Please go back and search the mountain, Bajie."@g]

57
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:47,835
The pig headed back up the road.

58
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:52,683
He had walked for a while when he saw a fox.

59
00:03:52,684 --> 00:03:56,023
"I know that's you, Wukong!" he shouted.

60
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:57,859
[g@He swung his rake.

61
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,297
The fox trotted away.@g]

62
00:04:00,298 --> 00:04:04,395
A robin flew past Bajie's head.

63
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:08,075
"Get away from me, Wukong!" yelled the pig.

64
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:13,447
As he waved the rake at the bird, Bajie tripped and fell.

65
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:15,784
"Wukong!" shouted the pig.

66
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:17,835
[g@"I know you're here.

67
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:21,036
You're invisible, and you just tripped me."@g]

68
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:24,741
He got back up and stood still for a moment.

69
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:31,330
When he didn't see or hear Wukong, he continued walking.

70
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:40,992
Every time Bajie saw an animal, he waved his rake and yelled.

71
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:44,043
[g@The road became very steep.

72
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:46,636
The pig soon came to a cave.@g]

73
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:51,250
In front of the cave was a demon.

74
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,425
[g@Bajie held out his rake.

75
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,386
"Tell me who you are!" he demanded.@g]

76
00:04:56,387 --> 00:05:00,378
[g@"My name is Golden Horn," said the demon.

77
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:02,529
"Who are you?"@g]

78
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,638
"I am Zhu Bajie," said the pig.

79
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,411
"I'm traveling to the Western Paradise with the Tang Monk."

80
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:12,497
[g@"Oh, the Tang Monk . . ."

81
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:16,167
A smile curled along the demon's lips.@g]

82
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:27,598
"I have heard that anyone who eats the Tang Monk will live forever."
