1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,696
One-Horned Buffalo went back into his cave and slammed the door shut.

2
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:22,271
"He stole my iron bar!" cried Wukong.

3
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,496
"What am I going to do?"

4
00:00:24,497 --> 00:00:26,280
He thought for a moment.

5
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:28,991
"That demon said he remembered me.

6
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:31,922
He also mentioned the Jade Emperor.

7
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:35,602
Maybe that demon escaped from Heaven."

8
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:41,111
The monkey shot into the sky and soon arrived at the southern gate of Heaven.

9
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:44,622
He told the guard everything that had happened.

10
00:00:44,623 --> 00:00:50,786
The guard sent a messenger to see if any spirits were missing from Heaven.

11
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:53,941
The messenger returned quickly with a warrior.

12
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:57,535
The warrior held a large sword.

13
00:00:57,536 --> 00:01:00,782
"The emperor sent me," said the warrior.

14
00:01:00,783 --> 00:01:03,054
"Nobody is missing from Heaven.

15
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:10,771
But I will arrest One-Horned Buffalo for you."

16
00:01:10,772 --> 00:01:15,855
Wukong returned to Earth with the warrior.

17
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:20,262
The warrior banged on the cave door.

18
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:24,474
"Open up, One-Horned Buffalo!"

19
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:28,141
The demon came outside and eyed the warrior.

20
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:30,168
"What do you want?"

21
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:32,682
The warrior puffed out his chest.

22
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:35,145
"I'm here to arrest you."

23
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:40,303
One-Horned Buffalo snorted. "Go away."

24
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:43,681
"How dare you tell me to go away!" said the warrior.

25
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:47,333
"The Jade Emperor sent me."

26
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:49,999
He pointed his sword at the demon.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,399
"If you don't come with me, I'll have to—"

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,949
One-Horned Buffalo held up the metal ring, and . . . whoosh!

29
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,016
The warrior's sword flew into it.

30
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:06,746
The warrior's face fell as he looked at his empty hand.

31
00:02:06,747 --> 00:02:12,071
The demon laughed and went back into his cave.

32
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:16,207
"That metal ring is powerful," said the warrior to Wukong.

33
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,693
"We need more help."

34
00:02:18,694 --> 00:02:22,980
They returned to Heaven and bowed before the Jade Emperor.

35
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:26,094
"I'm sorry, Your Majesty," said the warrior.

36
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:28,561
"But the demon stole my sword.

37
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,866
I need more help."

38
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:33,428
The Jade Emperor turned to his general.

39
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:39,282
"Send a fire god to Earth with these two."

40
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:42,724
A fire god joined Wukong and the warrior.

41
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:46,397
The god held a large, flaming spear.

42
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:52,238
"I'll arrest the demon for you," said the god.

43
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,660
The three of them went down to Earth and landed on the mountain.

44
00:02:56,661 --> 00:03:00,124
The fire god stood in front of the cave door.

45
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:05,930
He held up his fire spear and shouted, "Come out, One-Horned Buffalo!

46
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:08,428
You are under arrest!"

47
00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:12,824
The cave door opened, and the demon stepped outside.

48
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,859
"Who are you?"

49
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:20,418
"I'm a fire god, sent by the Jade Emperor," said the god.

50
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:22,433
One-Horned Buffalo laughed.

51
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:25,880
"I'm not afraid of you!"

52
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:29,605
The fire god threw the flaming spear at the demon.

53
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:32,932
But once again the demon held up the metal ring.

54
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,903
The spear was gone.

55
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:40,662
The demon returned to his cave.

56
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:42,204
Wukong shook his head.

57
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:45,657
"This is bad."

58
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:50,274
The three of them returned to Heaven and bowed before the Jade Emperor.

59
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:53,000
"Your Majesty," said the fire god.

60
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:56,022
"One-Horned Buffalo is very powerful.

61
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:58,206
I wasn't able to arrest him.

62
00:03:58,207 --> 00:04:01,917
We need more help."

63
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:05,600
The Jade Emperor sighed and turned to his general.

64
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:14,166
"Send a thunder god with them this time."

65
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:20,065
Back down on Earth, Wukong watched as the thunder god approached the cave door.

66
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:22,722
"Be careful," warned the warrior.

67
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:25,468
"Yes," said the fire god.

68
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:30,905
"The demon's metal ring is very dangerous."

69
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:33,044
The thunder god laughed.

70
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:35,610
"Don't worry about me!"

71
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:40,099
He turned to the cave door and boomed, "One-Horned Buffalo!

72
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,746
You are under arrest!"

73
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:47,448
The cave door opened, and One-Horned Buffalo stepped outside.

74
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:52,180
The thunder god instantly hurled his thunderbolt at the demon.

75
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:56,924
One-Horned Buffalo held up the metal ring and—whoosh!

76
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:59,391
The thunderbolt was gone.

77
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:03,534
The demon looked around at everyone and laughed.

78
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:06,849
"Thank you for all the weapons!"

79
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:16,462
He went back into his cave and slammed the door shut again.
