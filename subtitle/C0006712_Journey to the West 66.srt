1
00:00:11,000 --> 213:46:51,000
One-Horned Buffalo went back into his cave and slammed the door shut.

2
213:48:31,000 --> 313:05:11,000
[g@"He stole my iron bar!" cried Wukong.

3
313:06:51,000 --> 374:53:31,000
"What am I going to do?"@g]

4
374:55:11,000 --> 424:26:51,000
[g@He thought for a moment.

5
424:28:31,000 --> 499:45:11,000
"That demon said he remembered me.@g]

6
499:46:51,000 --> 581:10:11,000
[g@He also mentioned the Jade Emperor.

7
581:11:51,000 --> 683:23:31,000
Maybe that demon escaped from Heaven."@g]

8
683:25:11,000 --> 836:25:11,000
The monkey shot into the sky and soon arrived [n@at the southern gate of Heaven.

9
836:26:51,000 --> 933:56:51,000
He told the guard everything that had happened.

10
933:58:31,000 --> 1105:10:11,000
The guard sent a messenger to see if any spirits were missing from Heaven.

11
1105:11:51,000 --> 1192:48:31,000
The messenger returned quickly with a warrior.

12
1192:50:11,000 --> 1292:38:31,000
The warrior held a large sword.

13
1292:40:11,000 --> 1382:50:11,000
[g@"The emperor sent me," said the warrior.

14
1382:51:51,000 --> 1445:56:51,000
"Nobody is missing from Heaven.@g]

15
1445:58:31,000 --> 1660:18:31,000
But I will arrest One-Horned Buffalo for you."

16
1660:20:11,000 --> 1801:31:51,000
Wukong returned to Earth with the warrior.

17
1801:33:31,000 --> 1923:56:51,000
[g@The warrior banged on the cave door.

18
1923:58:31,000 --> 2040:56:51,000
"Open up, One-Horned Buffalo!"@g]

19
2040:58:31,000 --> 2142:48:31,000
[g@The demon came outside and eyed the warrior.

20
2142:50:11,000 --> 2199:06:51,000
"What do you want?"@g]

21
2199:08:31,000 --> 2268:56:51,000
[g@The warrior puffed out his chest.

22
2268:58:31,000 --> 2337:21:51,000
"I'm here to arrest you."@g]

23
2337:23:31,000 --> 2480:38:31,000
One-Horned Buffalo snorted. "Go away."

24
2480:40:11,000 --> 2574:28:31,000
"How dare you tell me to go away!" said the warrior.

25
2574:30:11,000 --> 2675:55:11,000
[g@"The Jade Emperor sent me."

26
2675:56:51,000 --> 2749:58:31,000
He pointed his sword at the demon.@g]

27
2750:00:11,000 --> 2844:25:11,000
"If you don't come with me, I'll have to—"

28
2844:26:51,000 --> 2970:48:31,000
One-Horned Buffalo held up the metal ring, and . . . [i@whoosh!@i]

29
2970:50:11,000 --> 3056:00:11,000
The warrior's sword flew into it.

30
3056:01:51,000 --> 3215:10:11,000
The warrior's face fell as he looked at his empty hand.

31
3215:11:51,000 --> 3363:05:11,000
The demon laughed and went back into his cave.

32
3363:06:51,000 --> 3477:58:31,000
"That metal ring is powerful," said the warrior to Wukong.

33
3478:00:11,000 --> 3547:01:51,000
"We need more help."

34
3547:03:31,000 --> 3666:06:51,000
They returned to Heaven and bowed before the Jade Emperor.

35
3666:08:31,000 --> 3752:36:51,000
"I'm sorry, Your Majesty," said the warrior.

36
3752:38:31,000 --> 3821:08:31,000
[g@"But the demon stole my sword.

37
3821:10:11,000 --> 3885:10:11,000
I need more help."@g]

38
3885:11:51,000 --> 3956:20:11,000
The Jade Emperor turned to his general.

39
3956:21:51,000 --> 4118:56:51,000
"Send a fire god to Earth with these two."

40
4118:58:31,000 --> 4214:33:31,000
A fire god joined Wukong and the warrior.

41
4214:35:11,000 --> 4316:35:11,000
The god held a large, flaming spear.

42
4316:36:51,000 --> 4478:50:11,000
"I'll arrest the demon for you," said the god.

43
4478:51:51,000 --> 4601:40:11,000
The three of them went down to Earth and landed on the mountain.

44
4601:41:51,000 --> 4697:53:31,000
The fire god stood in front of the cave door.

45
4697:55:11,000 --> 4859:10:11,000
He held up his fire spear and shouted, "Come out, One-Horned Buffalo!

46
4859:11:51,000 --> 4928:33:31,000
You are under arrest!"

47
4928:35:11,000 --> 5050:40:11,000
[g@The cave door opened, and the demon stepped outside.

48
5050:41:51,000 --> 5107:11:51,000
"Who are you?"@g]

49
5107:13:31,000 --> 5261:36:51,000
"I'm a fire god, sent by the Jade Emperor," said the god.

50
5261:38:31,000 --> 5317:35:11,000
[g@One-Horned Buffalo laughed.

51
5317:36:51,000 --> 5413:20:11,000
"I'm not afraid of you!"@g]

52
5413:21:51,000 --> 5516:48:31,000
The fire god threw the flaming spear at the demon.

53
5516:50:11,000 --> 5609:13:31,000
But once again the demon held up the metal ring.

54
5609:15:11,000 --> 5691:45:11,000
[g@The spear was gone.

55
5691:46:51,000 --> 5823:56:51,000
The demon returned to his cave.@g]

56
5823:58:31,000 --> 5866:46:51,000
[g@Wukong shook his head.

57
5866:48:31,000 --> 5962:41:51,000
"This is bad."@g]

58
5962:43:31,000 --> 6090:56:51,000
The three of them returned to Heaven and bowed before the Jade Emperor.

59
6090:58:31,000 --> 6166:40:11,000
[g@"Your Majesty," said the fire god.

60
6166:41:51,000 --> 6250:36:51,000
"One-Horned Buffalo is very powerful.@g]

61
6250:38:31,000 --> 6311:16:51,000
[g@I wasn't able to arrest him.

62
6311:18:31,000 --> 6414:21:51,000
We need more help."@g]

63
6414:23:31,000 --> 6516:40:11,000
The Jade Emperor sighed and turned to his general.

64
6516:41:51,000 --> 6754:36:51,000
"Send a thunder god with them this time."

65
6754:38:31,000 --> 6918:28:31,000
Back down on Earth, Wukong watched as the thunder [n@god approached the cave door.

66
6918:30:11,000 --> 6992:16:51,000
"Be careful," warned the warrior.

67
6992:18:31,000 --> 7068:33:31,000
[g@"Yes," said the fire god.

68
7068:35:11,000 --> 7219:35:11,000
"The demon's metal ring is very dangerous."@g]

69
7219:36:51,000 --> 7279:00:11,000
[g@The thunder god laughed.

70
7279:01:51,000 --> 7350:16:51,000
"Don't worry about me!"@g]

71
7350:18:31,000 --> 7474:58:31,000
He turned to the cave door and boomed, "One-Horned Buffalo!

72
7475:00:11,000 --> 7548:30:11,000
You are under arrest!"

73
7548:31:51,000 --> 7679:06:51,000
The cave door opened, and One-Horned Buffalo stepped outside.

74
7679:08:31,000 --> 7810:33:31,000
The thunder god instantly hurled his thunderbolt at the demon.

75
7810:35:11,000 --> 7942:20:11,000
One-Horned Buffalo held up the metal ring and—[i@whoosh!@i]

76
7942:21:51,000 --> 8010:51:51,000
The thunderbolt was gone.

77
8010:53:31,000 --> 8125:56:51,000
The demon looked around at everyone and laughed.

78
8125:58:31,000 --> 8218:01:51,000
"Thank you for all the weapons!"

79
8218:03:31,000 --> 8485:03:31,000
He went back into his cave and slammed the door shut again.
