"You cannot go back to that cave," said Guanyin.

2
163:51:50,933.3329999446869 --> 248:03:30,933.3329999446869
[g@"But we must go back!" said Wukong.

3
248:05:10,933.3329999446869 --> 329:50:10,933.3329999446869
"That woman kidnapped the Tang Monk."@g]

4
329:51:50,933.3329999446869 --> 382:13:30,933.3329999446869
Guanyin shook her head.

5
382:15:10,933.3329999446869 --> 453:21:50,933.3329999446869
[g@"That woman is a scorpion spirit.

6
453:23:30,933.3329999446869 --> 530:56:50,933.3329999446869
She is very dangerous."@g]

7
530:58:30,933.3329999446869 --> 607:31:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"She sure is!" cried Bajie.

8
607:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 689:41:50,933.3330001831055
"What did she stab us with anyway?"@g]

9
689:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 800:06:50,933.3330001831055
"It was her stinger that stabbed you," said Guanyin.

10
800:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 916:36:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong shuddered, thinking about the pain he'd felt.

11
916:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1002:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"I won't go near her," said Guanyin.

12
1002:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1111:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Even Buddha is afraid of her.@g]

1111:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1259:03:30,933.3330001831055
He was teaching his students one day and saw [n@that scorpion creeping toward him.

14
1259:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1359:28:30,933.3330001831055
[g@He tried to move it away, but it stung him.

15
1359:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1433:45:10,933.3330001831055
The pain was horrible!@g]

16
1433:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1527:01:50,933.3330001831055
[g@He told his guards to capture the scorpion.

17
1527:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1642:21:50,933.3330001831055
But it escaped to Earth."@g]

18
1642:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1713:16:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong started pacing.

19
1713:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1785:18:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"What are we going to do then?

20
1785:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1857:31:50,933.3330001831055
We must save the Tang Monk."@g]

21
1857:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1995:10:10,933.3330001831055
"Go to Heaven and ask the Star Lord for help," said Guanyin.

22
1995:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2192:23:30,933.3330001831055
The bodhisattva then disappeared in a flash of light.

23
2192:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2331:06:50,933.3330001831055
A little while later, Wukong stood at the southern gate of Heaven.

24
2331:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2406:38:30,933.3330001831055
"Greetings, Wukong," said the guard.

25
2406:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2511:03:30,933.3330001831055
"I must speak with the Star Lord," said the monkey.

26
2511:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2670:26:50,933.3330001831055
The guard told Wukong the way to the Star Lord's palace.

27
2670:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2853:20:10,933.3330001831055
A few minutes later, the monkey knocked on the palace door.

28
2853:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2990:50:10,933.3330001831055
"Wukong," said the Star Lord. "What can I do for you?"

29
2990:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3076:00:10,933.3330001831055
"I need your help," said Wukong.

30
3076:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3165:03:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm traveling to the Western Paradise with the Tang Monk.

3165:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3222:01:50,933.3330001831055
[g@But he was captured by a demon.

32
3222:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3311:00:10,933.3330001831055
Guanyin said you can help me."@g]

33
3311:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3395:45:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The Star Lord looked confused.

34
3395:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3450:33:30,933.3330001831055
"I don't know why you need my help.@g]

35
3450:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3509:38:30,933.3330001831055
[g@I've heard you're quite strong.

36
3509:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3577:33:30,933.3330001831055
What kind of demon is it?"@g]

37
3577:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3683:55:10,933.3330001831055
"It's a scorpion spirit," said the monkey.

38
3683:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3824:36:50,933.3330001831055
"Oh," said the Star Lord, nodding. "I understand now.

39
3824:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3930:20:10,933.3330001831055
Lead the way. We must hurry!"

40
3930:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4096:05:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong led the Star Lord out of Heaven and down to Earth.

41
4096:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4240:53:30,933.3330001831055
They landed on the mountain, where Bajie was still rubbing his nose.

42
4240:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4338:30:10,933.3330001831055
"The Star Lord is here to help us," said Wukong.

43
4338:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4420:28:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The Star Lord looked at Bajie's nose.

44
4420:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4489:16:50,933.3330001831055
"I can heal that for you."@g]

45
4489:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4649:30:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie walked over to the Star Lord, who then blew on the pig's nose.

46
4649:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4739:15:10,933.3330001831055
The injury healed instantly.

47
4739:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4825:20:10,933.3330001831055
"Thank you," said the pig, smiling.

48
4825:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4918:53:30,933.3330001831055
"I was stabbed too," said Wukong.

49
4918:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4988:50:10,933.3330001831055
"But the stinger didn't leave a mark on me."

50
4988:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5041:25:10,933.3330001831055
[g@He grinned at Bajie.

51
5041:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5125:08:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm much more powerful than the pig."@g]

52
5125:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5193:13:30,933.3330001831055
Bajie frowned.

53
5193:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5333:48:30,933.3330001831055
"I have special magic that I'll use to defeat [n@the scorpion," said the Star Lord.

54
5333:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5434:36:50,933.3330001831055
"You just need to get her to come outside."

55
5434:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5566:13:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Everyone went up to the cave.

56
5566:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5673:11:50,933.3330001831055
Bajie and Wujing hid behind some rocks.@g]

57
5673:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5859:46:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong stood in front of the cave entrance and shouted, [n@"Release our master right now!"

58
5859:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5970:11:50,933.3330001831055
Then he ran as fast as he could away from the cave.

59
5970:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6106:35:10,933.3330001831055
The woman rushed out of the cave, spinning wildly.

60
6106:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6221:25:10,933.3330001831055
Suddenly the Star Lord turned into an enormous rooster.

61
6221:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6346:38:30,933.3330001831055
The rooster crowed, and the sound echoed through the mountains.

62
6346:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6447:10:10,933.3330001831055
The woman screamed and held her hands over her ears.

63
6447:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6618:23:30,933.3330001831055
The rooster crowed again, and the woman disappeared in a puff of smoke.

64
6618:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6704:16:50,933.3330001831055
In her place was a dead scorpion.

65
6704:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6802:11:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong ran into the cave.

66
6802:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6918:41:50,933.3330001831055
He found the Tang Monk sitting at a table.@g]

67
6918:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6968:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The monk's eyes lit up.

68
6968:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7056:03:30,933.3330001831055
"Wukong! Thank you for saving me!"@g]

69
7056:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7107:30:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey smiled.

70
7107:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7242:50:10,933.3330001831055
"As long as I'm protecting you, no demon will ever harm you."

71
7242:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7307:33:30,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk shook his head.

72
7307:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7444:51:50,933.3330001831055
"That woman didn't want to harm meâ€”she wanted to marry me!"

73
7444:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7489:01:50,933.3330001831055
The monk sighed.

74
7489:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7608:55:10,933.3330001831055
"But I told her that I'm a Buddhist monk and I will never marry.

75
7608:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7805:21:50,933.3330001831055
My only goal is to reach the Western Paradise."
