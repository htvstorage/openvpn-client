00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:16,831
"You cannot go back to that cave," said Guanyin.

2
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:19,863
[g@"But we must go back!" said Wukong.

3
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:22,807
"That woman kidnapped the Tang Monk."@g]

4
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,693
Guanyin shook her head.

5
00:00:24,694 --> 00:00:27,254
[g@"That woman is a scorpion spirit.

6
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:30,047
She is very dangerous."@g]

7
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:32,804
[g@"She sure is!" cried Bajie.

8
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:35,762
"What did she stab us with anyway?"@g]

9
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:39,737
"It was her stinger that stabbed you," said Guanyin.

10
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:43,931
Wukong shuddered, thinking about the pain he'd felt.

11
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:47,017
[g@"I won't go near her," said Guanyin.

12
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:50,943
"Even Buddha is afraid of her.@g]

13
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:56,259
He was teaching his students one day and saw [n@that scorpion creeping toward him.

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,874
[g@He tried to move it away, but it stung him.

15
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,548
The pain was horrible!@g]

16
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:05,906
[g@He told his guards to capture the scorpion.

17
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:10,058
But it escaped to Earth."@g]

18
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:12,611
Wukong started pacing.

19
00:01:12,612 --> 00:01:15,204
[g@"What are we going to do then?

20
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:17,804
We must save the Tang Monk."@g]

21
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:22,759
"Go to Heaven and ask the Star Lord for help," said Guanyin.

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:29,859
The bodhisattva then disappeared in a flash of light.

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,853
A little while later, Wukong stood at the southern gate of Heaven.

24
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:37,572
"Greetings, Wukong," said the guard.

25
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:41,331
"I must speak with the Star Lord," said the monkey.

26
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:47,069
The guard told Wukong the way to the Star Lord's palace.

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,653
A few minutes later, the monkey knocked on the palace door.

28
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:58,603
"Wukong," said the Star Lord. "What can I do for you?"

29
00:01:58,604 --> 00:02:01,669
"I need your help," said Wukong.

30
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,875
"I'm traveling to the Western Paradise with the Tang Monk.

31
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,926
[g@But he was captured by a demon.

32
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:10,129
Guanyin said you can help me."@g]

33
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,180
[g@The Star Lord looked confused.

34
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:15,153
"I don't know why you need my help.@g]

35
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:17,280
[g@I've heard you're quite strong.

36
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,725
What kind of demon is it?"@g]

37
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:23,554
"It's a scorpion spirit," said the monkey.

38
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:28,619
"Oh," said the Star Lord, nodding. "I understand now.

39
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,425
Lead the way. We must hurry!"

40
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:38,392
Wukong led the Star Lord out of Heaven and down to Earth.

41
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:43,605
They landed on the mountain, where Bajie was still rubbing his nose.

42
00:02:43,606 --> 00:02:47,119
"The Star Lord is here to help us," said Wukong.

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,070
[g@The Star Lord looked at Bajie's nose.

44
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:52,547
"I can heal that for you."@g]

45
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:58,315
Bajie walked over to the Star Lord, who then blew on the pig's nose.

46
00:02:58,316 --> 00:03:01,546
The injury healed instantly.

47
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:04,645
"Thank you," said the pig, smiling.

48
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:08,013
"I was stabbed too," said Wukong.

49
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:10,531
"But the stinger didn't leave a mark on me."

50
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,424
[g@He grinned at Bajie.

51
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,438
"I'm much more powerful than the pig."@g]

52
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,889
Bajie frowned.

53
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,950
"I have special magic that I'll use to defeat [n@the scorpion," said the Star Lord.

54
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:26,579
"You just need to get her to come outside."

55
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,317
[g@Everyone went up to the cave.

56
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,168
Bajie and Wujing hid behind some rocks.@g]

57
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:41,885
Wukong stood in front of the cave entrance and shouted, [n@"Release our master right now!"

58
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:45,860
Then he ran as fast as he could away from the cave.

59
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:50,770
The woman rushed out of the cave, spinning wildly.

60
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:54,904
Suddenly the Star Lord turned into an enormous rooster.

61
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:59,412
The rooster crowed, and the sound echoed through the mountains.

62
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:03,031
The woman screamed and held her hands over her ears.

63
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:09,195
The rooster crowed again, and the woman disappeared in a puff of smoke.

64
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:12,287
In her place was a dead scorpion.

65
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:15,812
[g@Wukong ran into the cave.

66
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:20,006
He found the Tang Monk sitting at a table.@g]

67
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,803
[g@The monk's eyes lit up.

68
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:24,951
"Wukong! Thank you for saving me!"@g]

69
00:04:24,952 --> 00:04:26,803
The monkey smiled.

70
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:31,675
"As long as I'm protecting you, no demon will ever harm you."

71
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:34,005
The Tang Monk shook his head.

72
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:38,948
"That woman didn't want to harm meâ€”she wanted to marry me!"

73
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,538
The monk sighed.

74
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:44,854
"But I told her that I'm a Buddhist monk and I will never marry.

75
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:51,926
My only goal is to reach the Western Paradise."
