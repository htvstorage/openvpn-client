1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:16,340
The Black Wind King took a step back.

2
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:18,667
He looked confused.

3
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:24,259
"That pill jumped down my throat!"

4
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,531
The entire cave filled with light.

5
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:31,033
The bear squeezed his eyes shut.

6
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:35,542
When he opened them, Guanyin was standing before him.

7
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:41,563
"Guanyin!" the bear cried. "You tricked me with a disguise!"

8
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:45,424
"Return the robe at once," said Guanyin.

9
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:51,279
"No," said the Black Wind King.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,340
"I don't want to . . . Ugh."

11
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:58,498
He held his stomach and groaned.

12
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:02,337
"Are you feeling okay?" asked Wukong's voice.

13
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:05,050
The bear looked around, surprised.

14
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:08,453
"I just heard the monkey!"

15
00:01:08,454 --> 00:01:12,439
He fell to his knees and groaned again.

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,254
"Where are you?"

17
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:18,426
"I'm inside you!" said Wukong.

18
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:21,852
"I changed myself into a pill to trick you.

19
00:01:21,853 --> 00:01:25,576
Now I'm going to practice some of my fighting skills!"

20
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:29,303
The monkey punched and kicked the bear's insides.

21
00:01:29,304 --> 00:01:33,474
Boomph! Pow! Boomph! Pow!

22
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:39,340
"Aargh!" cried the Black Wind King, rolling on the floor.

23
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:44,789
Wukong jumped up and down, did flips, and ran around in circles.

24
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,878
"Please stop!" shouted the Black Wind King.

25
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,122
"You're hurting my belly!"

26
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:55,533
"Give back the robe," said Guanyin.

27
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:59,808
"I will, I promise!" said the bear.

28
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:02,157
"I will do anything you say!

29
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:07,201
Just please tell the monkey to stop!"

30
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:10,314
Guanyin held up a metal headband.

31
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:13,830
It looked just like the one on Wukong's head.

32
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:16,986
She placed it on the bear's head.

33
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:20,572
"Wukong, come out now," said Guanyin.

34
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:25,729
A tiny Wukong popped out of the Black Wind King's nose.

35
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,558
He quickly grew to his normal size.

36
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:32,586
"Where's the robe?" asked the monkey.

37
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:37,425
The bear pointed to a dark room in the back of the cave.

38
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:45,297
After Wukong left to get the robe, the Black Wind King charged at Guanyin.

39
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,623
But the bear was too slow.

40
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:51,514
Guanyin threw four more metal bands at him.

41
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:54,279
Two clamped onto his wrists.

42
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,986
The other two clamped onto his ankles.

43
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:07,871
When the bodhisattva began reciting a spell, the bear screamed. "Please stop!"

44
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:11,854
"Do you promise to be good?" asked Guanyin.

45
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:18,139
"Yes!" answered the Black Wind King. "I promise."

46
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,108
Wukong came back with the robe.

47
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:24,854
When he saw the bear, he laughed.

48
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:27,941
"You have five of those bands!"

49
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:33,256
The Black Wind King looked at the ground and sighed.

50
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:36,415
"I got the robe, Bodhisattva," said the monkey.

51
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,631
"What should we do with the bear?"

52
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:42,439
"I will show him mercy," said Guanyin.

53
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:49,186
"He can be my guardian on Mount Potalaka if he behaves."

54
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:56,380
The bodhisattva led the bear out of the cave and vanished.

55
00:03:56,381 --> 00:04:01,248
Wukong flew back to the monastery.

56
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:05,198
"You got the robe!" cried the Tang Monk when he saw the monkey.

57
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,719
"I did," said Wukong.

58
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,675
The two travelers headed west again.

59
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:16,473
Wukong told the monk about his adventure with the Black Wind King.

60
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:20,868
"I destroyed the Daoist priest," the monkey explained.

61
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:24,077
"He was really an evil wolf spirit.

62
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:27,153
Then Guanyin made herself look like him."

63
00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:31,748
"And you turned yourself into a pill," said the Tang Monk.

64
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:37,254
"And I went right into that bear's belly." Wukong laughed.

65
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:39,718
"He was very surprised!"

66
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:41,881
The Tang Monk smiled.

67
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:45,367
"I think we both learned a valuable lesson, Wukong.

68
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,938
I will never show anyone the robe again."

69
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:52,531
"That's a good idea," said Wukong.

70
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:54,836
"The robe is a gift from Buddha.

71
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,328
We must be careful . . ."

72
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:01,524
He stopped talking and pulled out his iron bar.

73
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:03,772
"There's a spirit nearby."

74
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:07,722
He looked toward a nearby cave.

75
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:09,503
There was a snort.

76
00:05:09,504 --> 00:05:12,652
The Tang Monk shook with fear.

77
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:22,857
A pig-like creature leaped from the cave, swinging a heavy rake.
