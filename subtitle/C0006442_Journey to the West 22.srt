140:56:51,266.66699999570847 --> 205:33:31,266.6670000553131
He looked confused.@g]

205:35:11,266.6670000553131 --> 360:53:31,266.6670000553131
"That pill jumped down my throat!"

4
360:55:11,266.6670000553131 --> 451:46:51,266.6670000553131
[g@The entire cave filled with light.

5
451:48:31,266.6670000553131 --> 549:03:31,266.6670000553131
The bear squeezed his eyes shut.@g]

549:05:11,266.6670000553131 --> 674:18:31,266.66699981689453
When he opened them, Guanyin was standing before him.

7
674:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 841:33:31,266.66699981689453
"Guanyin!" the bear cried. "You tricked me with a disguise!"

8
841:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 948:48:31,266.66699981689453
"Return the robe at once," said Guanyin.

9
948:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1111:26:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"No," said the Black Wind King.

1111:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1224:15:11,266.66699981689453
"I don't want to . . . Ugh."@g]

11
1224:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1311:58:31,266.66699981689453
He held his stomach and groaned.

12
1312:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1418:36:51,266.66699981689453
"Are you feeling okay?" asked Wukong's voice.

13
1418:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1493:58:31,266.66699981689453
[g@The bear looked around, surprised.

14
1494:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1588:30:11,266.66699981689453
"I just heard the monkey!"@g]

15
1588:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1699:13:31,266.66699981689453
[g@He fell to his knees and groaned again.

16
1699:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1777:25:11,266.66699981689453
"Where are you?"@g]

17
1777:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1865:31:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"I'm inside you!" said Wukong.

18
1865:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1960:41:51,266.66699981689453
"I changed myself into a pill to trick you.@g]

19
1960:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2064:08:31,266.66699981689453
Now I'm going to practice some of my fighting skills!"

20
2064:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2167:40:11,266.66699981689453
The monkey punched and kicked the bear's insides.

21
2167:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2283:31:51,266.66699981689453
[i@Boomph! Pow! Boomph! Pow!@i]

2283:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2446:28:31,266.66699981689453
"Aargh!" cried the Black Wind King, rolling on the floor.

23
2446:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2597:50:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong jumped up and down, did flips, and ran around in circles.

24
2597:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2711:25:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"Please stop!" shouted the Black Wind King.

25
2711:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2801:31:51,266.66699981689453
"You're hurting my belly!"@g]

26
2801:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2896:16:51,266.66699981689453
"Give back the robe," said Guanyin.

27
2896:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3015:01:51,266.66699981689453
"I will, I promise!" said the bear.

28
3015:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3080:16:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"I will do anything you say!

3080:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3220:23:31,266.66699981689453
Just please tell the monkey to stop!"@g]

30
3220:25:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3306:51:51,266.66699981689453
Guanyin held up a metal headband.

31
3306:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3404:31:51,266.66699981689453
It looked just like the one on Wukong's head.

32
3404:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3492:11:51,266.66699981689453
She placed it on the bear's head.

33
3492:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3591:48:31,266.66699981689453
"Wukong, come out now," said Guanyin.

34
3591:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3735:03:31,266.66699981689453
A tiny Wukong popped out of the Black Wind King's nose.

35
3735:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3841:25:11,266.66699981689453
He quickly grew to his normal size.

36
3841:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3925:31:51,266.66699981689453
"Where's the robe?" asked the monkey.

37
3925:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4059:56:51,266.66699981689453
The bear pointed to a dark room in the back of the cave.

38
4059:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4278:36:51,266.66699981689453
After Wukong left to get the robe, the Black Wind King charged at Guanyin.

39
4278:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4343:13:31,266.66699981689453
[g@But the bear was too slow.

40
4343:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4451:18:31,266.66699981689453
Guanyin threw four more metal bands at him.@g]

41
4451:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4528:06:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Two clamped onto his wrists.

42
4528:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4658:51:51,266.66699981689453
The other two clamped onto his ankles.@g]

43
4658:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4905:40:11,266.66699981689453
When the bodhisattva began reciting a spell, [n@the bear screamed. "Please stop!"

44
4905:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5016:18:31,266.66699981689453
"Do you promise to be good?" asked Guanyin.

45
5016:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5190:53:31,266.66699981689453
"Yes!" answered the Black Wind King. "I promise."

46
5190:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5273:21:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Wukong came back with the robe.

47
5273:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5377:25:11,266.66699981689453
When he saw the bear, he laughed.@g]

48
5377:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5463:10:11,266.66699981689453
"You have five of those bands!"

49
5463:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5610:48:31,266.66699981689453
The Black Wind King looked at the ground and sighed.

50
5610:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5698:33:31,266.66699981689453
"I got the robe, Bodhisattva," said the monkey.

51
5698:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5760:06:51,266.66699981689453
"What should we do with the bear?"

52
5760:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5865:53:31,266.66699981689453
"I will show him mercy," said Guanyin.

53
5865:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6053:18:31,266.66699981689453
"He can be my guardian on Mount Potalaka if he behaves."

54
6053:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6253:08:31,266.66699981689453
The bodhisattva led the bear out of the cave and vanished.

55
6253:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6388:21:51,266.66699981689453
Wukong flew back to the monastery.

56
6388:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6498:05:11,266.66699981689453
"You got the robe!" cried the Tang Monk when he saw the monkey.

57
6498:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6595:53:31,266.66699981689453
"I did," said Wukong.

58
6595:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6678:00:11,266.66699981689453
The two travelers headed west again.

59
6678:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6811:16:51,266.66699981689453
Wukong told the monk about his adventure with the Black Wind King.

60
6811:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6933:21:51,266.66699981689453
"I destroyed the Daoist priest," the monkey explained.

61
6933:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7022:30:11,266.66699981689453
"He was really an evil wolf spirit.

62
7022:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7107:56:51,266.66699981689453
Then Guanyin made herself look like him."

63
7107:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7235:35:11,266.66699981689453
"And you turned yourself into a pill," said the Tang Monk.

64
7235:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7388:31:51,266.66699981689453
"And I went right into that bear's belly." Wukong laughed.

65
7388:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7456:58:31,266.66699981689453
"He was very surprised!"

66
7457:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7517:03:31,266.66699981689453
[g@The Tang Monk smiled.

67
7517:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7613:53:31,266.66699981689453
"I think we both learned a valuable lesson, Wukong.@g]

68
7613:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7713:05:11,266.66699981689453
I will never show anyone the robe again."

69
7713:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7812:53:31,266.66699981689453
"That's a good idea," said Wukong.

70
7812:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7876:55:11,266.66699981689453

7946:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8062:41:51,266.66699981689453
He stopped talking and pulled out his iron bar.

73
8062:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8125:08:31,266.66699981689453

8284:21:51,266.66699981689453 --> 8371:48:31,266.66699981689453
The Tang Monk shook with fear.@g]

8371:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8655:16:51,266.66699981689453
A pig-like creature leaped from the cave, swinging a heavy rake.
