"Are you sure you can help?" Wukong asked the Buddha Maitreya.

2
214:51:50,933.3329999446869 --> 271:31:50,933.3329999446869
[g@"Yellow Brows is powerful.

271:33:30,933.3329999446869 --> 356:28:30,933.3329999446869
He captured everyone with a magic cloth.@g]

4
356:30:10,933.3329999446869 --> 442:16:50,933.3329999446869
He trapped me in a pair of cymbals."

5
442:18:30,933.3329999446869 --> 537:46:50,933.3329999446869
[g@"I can defeat Yellow Brows," said Maitreya.

537:48:30,933.3329999446869 --> 599:15:10,933.3330001831055
"He used to be my student.@g]

7
599:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 748:03:30,933.3330001831055
The cloth and cymbals are precious Buddhist [n@treasures that he stole from me."

8
748:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 935:38:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong gulped. "Sorry, but I, um . . . destroyed the cymbals."

9
935:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1023:10:10,933.3330001831055
Maitreya smiled. "Don't worry about that.

1023:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1097:25:10,933.3330001831055
[g@We must capture Yellow Brows.

1097:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1201:23:30,933.3330001831055
I'll tell you my plan."@g]

1201:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1302:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong stormed up to the monastery door again.

13
1302:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1378:45:10,933.3330001831055
"Yellow Brows!" he shouted.@g]

14
1378:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1481:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Return my friends or I'll smash your entire mountain!"

15
1481:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1645:18:30,933.3330001831055
The door flew open, and Yellow Brows stepped out.

16
1645:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1730:30:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"How dare you threaten me?

17
1730:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1838:46:50,933.3330001831055
Do you know how powerful I am?"@g]

18
1838:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1921:40:10,933.3330001831055
"You're not powerful," said the monkey.

19
1921:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2005:05:10,933.3330001831055
"You just think you are because you have that cloth.

20
2005:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2124:13:30,933.3330001831055
I bet you're too scared to fight me without it."

21
2124:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2231:53:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm not scared of you," said the demon.

22
2231:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2345:18:30,933.3330001831055
He went back inside and came back a moment later.

23
2345:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2465:36:50,933.3330001831055
He was holding a heavy wooden club.

24
2465:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2586:10:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong pulled out his iron bar as the demon rushed toward him.

25
2586:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2703:33:30,933.3330001831055
[i@Wham!@i] Their weapons smashed together again and again.

26
2703:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2822:58:30,933.3330001831055
As he fought the demon, Wukong took small steps backward.

27
2823:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3055:03:30,933.3330001831055
Slowly he moved the fight away from the monastery.

28
3055:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3170:00:10,933.3330001831055
Soon they were fighting in the valley at the bottom of the mountain.

29
3170:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3315:15:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong took another swing at Yellow Brows and then pretended to be scared.

30
3315:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3408:38:30,933.3330001831055
"You are too powerful!" cried the monkey.

31
3408:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3466:40:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"I can't fight you anymore!"

32
3466:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3529:21:50,933.3330001831055
He turned and ran away.@g]

33
3529:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3625:28:30,933.3330001831055
"Hey!" yelled Yellow Brows.

34
3625:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3693:21:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Get back here, coward!"

35
3693:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3800:01:50,933.3330001831055
The demon ran after Wukong.@g]

36
3800:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3929:55:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey ran through some woods and into a melon field.

37
3929:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4000:50:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Yellow Brows chased him.

38
4000:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4124:31:50,933.3330001831055
"Where are you, Wukong?" he shouted.@g]

39
4124:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4215:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Then the demon noticed all the melons.

40
4215:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4271:15:10,933.3330001831055
He licked his lips.@g]

41
4271:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4389:38:30,933.3330001831055
"These melons look delicious," he said to himself.

42
4389:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4452:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@A farmer was working nearby.

43
4452:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4518:30:10,933.3330001831055
He had a big belly.@g]

44
4518:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4602:43:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Hey, farmer!" called Yellow Brows.

45
4602:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4696:38:30,933.3330001831055
"Give me one of your melons!"@g]

46
4696:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4777:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The farmer put down his rake and smiled.

47
4777:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4892:13:30,933.3330001831055
He walked over to the demon.@g]

48
4892:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4983:03:30,933.3330001831055
"I'll find a nice, ripe melon for you."

49
4983:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5098:08:30,933.3330001831055
The farmer searched the ground.

50
5098:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5165:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Finally he held up a ripe melon.

51
5165:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5221:41:50,933.3330001831055
"Here you go!"@g]

52
5221:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5321:20:10,933.3330001831055
Yellow Brows lifted the melon to take a bite.

53
5321:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5423:25:10,933.3330001831055
Suddenly the melon shrank to the size of a berry.

54
5423:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5555:10:10,933.3330001831055
It leaped out of his hand and went right down his throat.

55
5555:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5598:28:30,933.3330001831055
[i@Gulp!@i]

56
5598:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5665:56:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The demon fell to his knees.

57
5665:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5781:11:50,933.3330001831055
"Ugh! What was wrong with that melon?"@g]

58
5781:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5891:01:50,933.3330001831055
Inside the demon, Wukong punched and kicked.

59
5891:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5990:13:30,933.3330001831055
[i@Boomph! Pow! Boomph! Pow!@i]

60
5990:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6111:38:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Aargh!" cried Yellow Brows.

61
6111:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6184:26:50,933.3330001831055
Then he noticed the farmer was gone.@g]

62
6184:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6273:03:30,933.3330001831055
Instead, Maitreya stood over him.

63
6273:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6335:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Maitreya glared at the demon.

64
6335:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6477:21:50,933.3330001831055
"Give me my magic cloth."@g]

65
6477:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6560:56:50,933.3330001831055
"Y-yes, Master."

66
6560:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6728:23:30,933.3330001831055
Yellow Brows pulled the cloth from his robe and handed it to Maitreya.

67
6728:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6832:36:50,933.3330001831055
"You may come out now, Wukong," said Maitreya.

68
6832:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6930:30:10,933.3330001831055
A tiny Wukong leaped from the demon's nose.

69
6930:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7029:20:10,933.3330001831055
Maitreya threw the cloth at Yellow Brows.

70
7029:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7175:30:10,933.3330001831055
It wrapped around the demon and became small.

71
7175:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7258:08:30,933.3330001831055
Maitreya put the bundle into a pocket.

72
7258:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7393:51:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong returned to his normal size.

73
7393:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7472:38:30,933.3330001831055
He and Maitreya went to the monastery.@g]

74
7472:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7647:25:10,933.3330001831055
Maitreya recited a spell, and the cymbals repaired themselves.

75
7647:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7740:33:30,933.3330001831055
[g@He smiled at Wukong. "Good luck!"

76
7740:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7845:45:10,933.3330001831055
Then he vanished.@g]

77
7845:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7977:30:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong untied his companions and the other spirits.

78
7977:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8129:16:50,933.3330001831055
The dragon, the turtle, and the serpent thanked the monkey and flew away.

79
8129:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8205:50:10,933.3330001831055
"Thank you, Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

80
8205:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8316:30:10,933.3330001831055
"I'm sorry for not believing you when you warned us about this place."

81
8316:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8381:51:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong laughed.

82
8381:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8632:48:30,933.3330001831055
"Maybe you'll believe me one of these days, Master!"@g]

83
8632:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8879:11:50,933.3330001831055
The travelers went outside and continued west.
