1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:18,667
"Are you sure you can help?" Wukong asked the Buddha Maitreya.

2
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:20,708
"Yellow Brows is powerful.

3
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:23,766
He captured everyone with a magic cloth.

4
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:26,855
He trapped me in a pair of cymbals."

5
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:30,293
"I can defeat Yellow Brows," said Maitreya.

6
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:32,506
"He used to be my student.

7
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:37,863
The cloth and cymbals are precious Buddhist treasures that he stole from me."

8
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:44,616
Wukong gulped. "Sorry, but I, um . . . destroyed the cymbals."

9
00:00:44,617 --> 00:00:47,767
Maitreya smiled. "Don't worry about that.

10
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:50,440
We must capture Yellow Brows.

11
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:54,183
I'll tell you my plan."

12
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:57,838
Wukong stormed up to the monastery door again.

13
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:00,568
"Yellow Brows!" he shouted.

14
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:04,267
"Return my friends or I'll smash your entire mountain!"

15
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:10,164
The door flew open, and Yellow Brows stepped out.

16
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:13,231
"How dare you threaten me?

17
00:01:13,232 --> 00:01:17,129
Do you know how powerful I am?"

18
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,113
"You're not powerful," said the monkey.

19
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:23,116
"You just think you are because you have that cloth.

20
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:27,405
I bet you're too scared to fight me without it."

21
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:31,281
"I'm not scared of you," said the demon.

22
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:35,364
He went back inside and came back a moment later.

23
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:39,695
He was holding a heavy wooden club.

24
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:44,035
Wukong pulled out his iron bar as the demon rushed toward him.

25
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:48,261
Wham! Their weapons smashed together again and again.

26
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:52,560
As he fought the demon, Wukong took small steps backward.

27
00:01:52,561 --> 00:02:00,915
Slowly he moved the fight away from the monastery.

28
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:05,053
Soon they were fighting in the valley at the bottom of the mountain.

29
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:10,282
Wukong took another swing at Yellow Brows and then pretended to be scared.

30
00:02:10,283 --> 00:02:13,644
"You are too powerful!" cried the monkey.

31
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:15,733
"I can't fight you anymore!"

32
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,990
He turned and ran away.

33
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:21,450
"Hey!" yelled Yellow Brows.

34
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:23,894
"Get back here, coward!"

35
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:27,734
The demon ran after Wukong.

36
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:32,410
The monkey ran through some woods and into a melon field.

37
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:34,963
Yellow Brows chased him.

38
00:02:34,964 --> 00:02:39,416
"Where are you, Wukong?" he shouted.

39
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:42,698
Then the demon noticed all the melons.

40
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:44,698
He licked his lips.

41
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,960
"These melons look delicious," he said to himself.

42
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,217
A farmer was working nearby.

43
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:53,599
He had a big belly.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,631
"Hey, farmer!" called Yellow Brows.

45
00:02:56,632 --> 00:03:00,012
"Give me one of your melons!"

46
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,927
The farmer put down his rake and smiled.

47
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:07,053
He walked over to the demon.

48
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:10,323
"I'll find a nice, ripe melon for you."

49
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:14,466
The farmer searched the ground.

50
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:16,901
Finally he held up a ripe melon.

51
00:03:16,902 --> 00:03:18,914
"Here you go!"

52
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:22,501
Yellow Brows lifted the melon to take a bite.

53
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:26,176
Suddenly the melon shrank to the size of a berry.

54
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:30,919
It leaped out of his hand and went right down his throat.

55
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,478
Gulp!

56
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,907
The demon fell to his knees.

57
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:39,056
"Ugh! What was wrong with that melon?"

58
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:43,010
Inside the demon, Wukong punched and kicked.

59
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:46,581
Boomph! Pow! Boomph! Pow!

60
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:50,952
"Aargh!" cried Yellow Brows.

61
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:53,573
Then he noticed the farmer was gone.

62
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:56,763
Instead, Maitreya stood over him.

63
00:03:56,764 --> 00:03:59,026
Maitreya glared at the demon.

64
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:04,118
"Give me my magic cloth."

65
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,127
"Y-yes, Master."

66
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:13,155
Yellow Brows pulled the cloth from his robe and handed it to Maitreya.

67
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:16,907
"You may come out now, Wukong," said Maitreya.

68
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:20,431
A tiny Wukong leaped from the demon's nose.

69
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:23,989
Maitreya threw the cloth at Yellow Brows.

70
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:29,251
It wrapped around the demon and became small.

71
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:32,226
Maitreya put the bundle into a pocket.

72
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:37,112
Wukong returned to his normal size.

73
00:04:37,113 --> 00:04:39,948
He and Maitreya went to the monastery.

74
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:46,240
Maitreya recited a spell, and the cymbals repaired themselves.

75
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:49,593
He smiled at Wukong. "Good luck!"

76
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:53,380
Then he vanished.

77
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:58,123
Wukong untied his companions and the other spirits.

78
00:04:58,124 --> 00:05:03,587
The dragon, the turtle, and the serpent thanked the monkey and flew away.

79
00:05:03,588 --> 00:05:06,343
"Thank you, Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

80
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:10,327
"I'm sorry for not believing you when you warned us about this place."

81
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:12,680
Wukong laughed.

82
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:21,714
"Maybe you'll believe me one of these days, Master!"

83
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:30,584
The travelers went outside and continued west.
