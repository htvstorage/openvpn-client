[g@The Tang Monk trembled with fear.

160:21:51,266.6670000553131 --> 250:05:11,266.6670000553131
The animals showed their fangs.@g]

250:06:51,266.6670000553131 --> 323:10:11,266.6670000553131
"Master!" cried Wukong.

4
323:11:51,266.6670000553131 --> 393:05:11,266.6670000553131
The monkey was running fast.

5
393:06:51,266.6670000553131 --> 580:26:51,266.6670000553131
He swung his iron bar, and the animals ran back into the forest.

6
580:28:31,266.6670000553131 --> 720:10:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong smiled. "Sorry for making the horse run, Master.

7
720:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 802:51:51,266.66699981689453
I thought it would be funny."

802:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 872:00:11,266.66699981689453
[g@The Tang Monk frowned.

872:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 924:00:11,266.66699981689453
"It wasn't funny at all!@g]

924:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 999:50:11,266.66699981689453
Those beasts were going to attack me!"

11
999:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1074:36:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"Nonsense," said Wukong.

12
1074:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1151:13:31,266.66699981689453
"You never have to fear any wild animals.@g]

13
1151:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1249:33:31,266.66699981689453
You have three powerful companions."

14
1249:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1390:03:31,266.66699981689453
Bajie and Wujing soon caught up to them.

15
1390:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1473:31:51,266.66699981689453
They all continued along the road.

16
1473:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1581:06:51,266.66699981689453
The Tang Monk pointed to a building up ahead.

17
1581:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1649:43:31,266.66699981689453
"That looks like a Daoist abbey."

18
1649:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1816:11:51,266.66699981689453
"I'm sure the abbey's priests will let us rest for a while," said Wujing.

19
1816:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1961:41:51,266.66699981689453
When they reached the abbey, Bajie knocked on the door.

20
1961:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2029:00:11,266.66699981689453
Two priests opened it.

21
2029:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2122:01:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"I'm here with the Tang Monk," said the pig.

22
2122:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2172:38:31,266.66699981689453
"May we come in?"@g]

23
2172:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2258:23:31,266.66699981689453
The priests looked at the Tang Monk.

24
2258:25:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2349:08:31,266.66699981689453
"Our master told us about you," said one of them.

25
2349:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2422:41:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"He said you would travel past our abbey someday.

2422:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2503:58:31,266.66699981689453
Please, come in."@g]

2504:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2580:40:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"Who is your master?" asked the Tang Monk.

28
2580:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2641:56:51,266.66699981689453
"How did he know about me?"@g]

29
2641:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2746:16:51,266.66699981689453
"Our master is the Great Immortal," said the first priest.

30
2746:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2863:01:51,266.66699981689453
"He is very wise and powerful."

31
2863:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2941:51:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Wukong laughed. "I've never heard of him.

32
2941:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3017:31:51,266.66699981689453
I doubt he's very powerful."@g]

33
3017:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3101:51:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The Tang Monk scowled.

34
3101:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3207:16:51,266.66699981689453
"Show some respect, Wukong," he whispered.@g]

35
3207:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3272:16:51,266.66699981689453
The priests looked annoyed.

36
3272:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3382:43:31,266.66699981689453
"Our master is visiting friends in Heaven right now.

37
3382:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3504:36:51,266.66699981689453
If he wasn't powerful, he wouldn't be able to do that."

38
3504:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3624:55:11,266.66699981689453
[g@Wukong shrugged. "I used to live in Heaven.

39
3624:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3748:06:51,266.66699981689453
The place isn't that great."@g]

40
3748:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3823:08:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

41
3823:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3964:38:31,266.66699981689453
"Please go outside and tend the horse."@g]

3964:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4063:06:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Wukong went back outside.

43
4063:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4199:51:51,266.66699981689453
Wujing went out to get the bags.@g]

4199:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4281:25:11,266.66699981689453
"May I use the kitchen?" asked Bajie.

45
4281:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4384:08:31,266.66699981689453
"I want to cook some food for the Tang Monk."

46
4384:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4469:35:11,266.66699981689453
"It's through that door," said one priest.

47
4469:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4565:58:31,266.66699981689453
He pointed to a door in the back of the room.

48
4566:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4699:53:31,266.66699981689453
Bajie went into the kitchen while the Tang Monk talked to the priests.

49
4699:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4817:05:11,266.66699981689453
"There's a ginseng tree behind the abbey," said one priest.

50
4817:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4918:51:51,266.66699981689453
"Its fruit takes ten thousand years to become ripe.

4918:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5049:10:11,266.66699981689453
According to legend, one bite of the fruit will make you live forever.

52
5049:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5106:05:11,266.66699981689453
Would you like one?"

53
5106:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5213:08:31,266.66699981689453
"A fruit like that is a true treasure," said the Tang Monk.

54
5213:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5296:15:11,266.66699981689453
"Will your master be upset if I eat it?"

55
5296:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5415:21:51,266.66699981689453
"Our master said we could give you one," said the other priest.

56
5415:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5483:46:51,266.66699981689453
"We'll go and cut one down."

5483:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5599:25:11,266.66699981689453
The two priests went outside.

58
5599:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5780:28:31,266.66699981689453
[g@A moment later they came back in with a tray.

5780:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5845:01:51,266.66699981689453
The Tang Monk screamed.@g]

5845:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5955:13:31,266.66699981689453
On the tray lay a tiny sleeping baby.

61
5955:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6102:03:31,266.66699981689453
"I can't eat that," cried the monk. "Itâ€”it's a baby!"

62
6102:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6186:01:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"It's not a baby," said one priest.

63
6186:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6244:25:11,266.66699981689453
"It's a ginseng fruit.@g]

6244:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6389:06:51,266.66699981689453
It only looks like a baby to you because you're a mortal."

65
6389:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6478:08:31,266.66699981689453
"Please take it away!" cried the Tang Monk.

66
6478:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6615:28:31,266.66699981689453
The priests tried to convince him that the fruit wasn't a baby.

67
6615:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6769:48:31,266.66699981689453
But the monk just shook his head.

68
6769:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6910:35:11,266.66699981689453
The priests took the ginseng fruit out of the room and into a hallway.

6910:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7005:53:31,266.66699981689453
