1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:17,039
[g@The Tang Monk trembled with fear.

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,270
The animals showed their fangs.@g]

3
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,901
"Master!" cried Wukong.

4
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:25,418
The monkey was running fast.

5
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:32,163
He swung his iron bar, and the animals ran back into the forest.

6
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:37,193
Wukong smiled. "Sorry for making the horse run, Master.

7
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:40,170
I thought it would be funny."

8
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,659
[g@The Tang Monk frowned.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,531
"It wasn't funny at all!@g]

10
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:47,261
Those beasts were going to attack me!"

11
00:00:47,262 --> 00:00:49,953
[g@"Nonsense," said Wukong.

12
00:00:49,954 --> 00:00:52,711
"You never have to fear any wild animals.@g]

13
00:00:52,712 --> 00:00:56,251
You have three powerful companions."

14
00:00:56,252 --> 00:01:01,309
Bajie and Wujing soon caught up to them.

15
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,314
They all continued along the road.

16
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:08,187
The Tang Monk pointed to a building up ahead.

17
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:10,657
"That looks like a Daoist abbey."

18
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:16,650
"I'm sure the abbey's priests will let us rest for a while," said Wujing.

19
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:21,888
When they reached the abbey, Bajie knocked on the door.

20
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:24,311
Two priests opened it.

21
00:01:24,312 --> 00:01:27,660
[g@"I'm here with the Tang Monk," said the pig.

22
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:29,482
"May we come in?"@g]

23
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:32,569
The priests looked at the Tang Monk.

24
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,836
"Our master told us about you," said one of them.

25
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:38,484
[g@"He said you would travel past our abbey someday.

26
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:41,410
Please, come in."@g]

27
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:44,171
[g@"Who is your master?" asked the Tang Monk.

28
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:46,377
"How did he know about me?"@g]

29
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:50,133
"Our master is the Great Immortal," said the first priest.

30
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:54,336
"He is very wise and powerful."

31
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:57,174
[g@Wukong laughed. "I've never heard of him.

32
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:59,898
I doubt he's very powerful."@g]

33
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,934
[g@The Tang Monk scowled.

34
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:06,729
"Show some respect, Wukong," he whispered.@g]

35
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,069
The priests looked annoyed.

36
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,045
"Our master is visiting friends in Heaven right now.

37
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:17,433
If he wasn't powerful, he wouldn't be able to do that."

38
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:21,764
[g@Wukong shrugged. "I used to live in Heaven.

39
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:26,199
The place isn't that great."@g]

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,900
[g@"Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

41
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:33,994
"Please go outside and tend the horse."@g]

42
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:37,539
[g@Wukong went back outside.

43
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,462
Wujing went out to get the bags.@g]

44
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:45,398
"May I use the kitchen?" asked Bajie.

45
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:49,096
"I want to cook some food for the Tang Monk."

46
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:52,172
"It's through that door," said one priest.

47
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:55,642
He pointed to a door in the back of the room.

48
00:02:55,643 --> 00:03:00,463
Bajie went into the kitchen while the Tang Monk talked to the priests.

49
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:04,682
"There's a ginseng tree behind the abbey," said one priest.

50
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:08,346
"Its fruit takes ten thousand years to become ripe.

51
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:13,037
According to legend, one bite of the fruit will make you live forever.

52
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:15,086
Would you like one?"

53
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:18,940
"A fruit like that is a true treasure," said the Tang Monk.

54
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:21,932
"Will your master be upset if I eat it?"

55
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:26,220
"Our master said we could give you one," said the other priest.

56
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:28,683
"We'll go and cut one down."

57
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:32,846
The two priests went outside.

58
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:39,364
[g@A moment later they came back in with a tray.

59
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:41,688
The Tang Monk screamed.@g]

60
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:45,655
On the tray lay a tiny sleeping baby.

61
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:50,941
"I can't eat that," cried the monk. "It—it's a baby!"

62
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:53,964
[g@"It's not a baby," said one priest.

63
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:56,066
"It's a ginseng fruit.@g]

64
00:03:56,067 --> 00:04:01,275
It only looks like a baby to you because you're a mortal."

65
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:04,480
"Please take it away!" cried the Tang Monk.

66
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:09,424
The priests tried to convince him that the fruit wasn't a baby.

67
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:14,980
But the monk just shook his head.

68
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:20,048
The priests took the ginseng fruit out of the room and into a hallway.

69
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,479
"We shouldn't waste this fruit," said one priest.

70
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,504
"No," said the other.

71
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:27,424
[g@"It is too delicious and valuable.

72
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:29,506
Let's eat it ourselves."@g]

73
00:04:29,507 --> 00:04:32,737
[g@The two priests shared the ginseng fruit.

74
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:35,722
Bajie was in the kitchen nearby.@g]

75
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:38,212
[g@He had heard everything they'd said.

76
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:41,155
His stomach growled.@g]

77
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:44,905
[g@"That fruit sounds wonderful," said Bajie to himself.

78
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:50,256
"I want some too!"@g]
