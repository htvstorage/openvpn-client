1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:17,522
Wukong stood before Guanyin.

2
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:22,585
He was telling the bodhisattva everything that had happened at the monastery.

3
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:28,084
"Then a bear spirit called the Black Wind King stole the robe," the monkey went on.

4
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:31,400
"I demanded he give it back.

5
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:36,893
We fought—until the bear spirit said it was lunchtime and hid in his cave.

6
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:41,097
I kicked the door and yelled insults at him for more than an hour.

7
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:44,631
But he wouldn't come out.

8
00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:47,880
You must help me."

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:55,313
Guanyin sighed. "The Tang Monk should not have shown that robe to the priest," she said.

10
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:58,548
"The robe is a Buddhist treasure.

11
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:02,827
When other people see it, they will want it.

12
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:08,652
And as that head priest tried to do, they might harm the Tang Monk."

13
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:11,142
"I agree," said Wukong.

14
00:01:11,143 --> 00:01:17,014
"I've told the Tang Monk many times not to do dumb things. But still he—"

15
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:23,589
"And you should have put out that fire," Guanyin said, interrupting Wukong.

16
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,887
"What you did was terrible!"

17
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:29,840
Wukong looked at the ground.

18
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:32,104
He kicked a pebble.

19
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:35,164
"I know," he mumbled.

20
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:41,366
"I'll help you get back the robe," said Guanyin. "Let's go."

21
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:46,006
Wukong and Guanyin soared over the ocean.

22
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:49,766
Soon they landed on the mountain.

23
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:54,557
"Where is the Black Wind King's cave?" asked Guanyin.

24
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:56,855
"It's close," said Wukong.

25
00:01:56,856 --> 00:01:58,802
"We should sneak up to it."

26
00:01:58,803 --> 00:02:01,475
They heard footsteps coming closer.

27
00:02:01,476 --> 00:02:06,488
Wukong and Guanyin hid as a Daoist priest walked along the path.

28
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:08,793
The priest was holding a tray.

29
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:12,247
A bright purple pill sat on the tray.

30
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:15,482
The priest was talking to himself.

31
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:18,379
"This is an exciting day," he said.

32
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,227
"The Black Wind King has a new robe that is a Buddhist treasure.

33
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:24,910
And I hope he likes the pill I made for him.

34
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:30,764
It will make him live forever."

35
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:38,504
Wukong stared at the priest, using his magic sight.

36
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:41,577
"That's not a priest!" Wukong realized.

37
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,129
"It's a wolf spirit dressed as a priest."

38
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,759
The monkey's eyes lit up.

39
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,726
"I have an idea, Bodhisattva!"

40
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:57,960
A little while later, the priest stood before the Black Wind King's cave door.

41
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:01,505
He knocked and the door flew open.

42
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:07,187
"Are you still here, you little monkey?" shouted the Black Wind King.

43
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:10,061
Then he saw the priest and smiled.

44
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:12,705
"Oh, it's you, my old friend!

45
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:14,737
Sorry for yelling.

46
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:19,147
A pesky monkey spirit was here a little while ago."

47
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:20,575
He looked around.

48
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,417
"I guess he's gone."

49
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:27,612
"A monkey spirit was here?" asked the priest.

50
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:29,657
"Yes," said the bear.

51
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:33,295
"He kept banging on my door and yelling at me.

52
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,840
He was very rude."

53
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:41,663
The Black Wind King patted the priest on the shoulder.

54
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:44,103
"But let's not talk about him.

55
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:45,640
It's good to see you.

56
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:48,223
How have you been?"

57
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:50,582
"I'm well," said the priest.

58
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:54,787
"I brought you a gift, to celebrate your new Buddhist treasure."

59
00:03:54,788 --> 00:03:57,463
He held up the tray with the pill.

60
00:03:57,464 --> 00:04:00,298
The Black Wind King looked interested.

61
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,550
"What kind of pill is that?"

62
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:07,388
"It is a very special pill," said the priest with a smile.

63
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,216
"I made it just for you.

64
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:11,788
It will make you live forever."

65
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:15,296
The Black Wind King stroked his chin.

66
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:22,210
"You know, I was just thinking this morning that I would like to live forever."

67
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:26,000
The bear picked up the pill and opened his mouth wide.

68
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:30,620
As he brought the pill up to his mouth, the pill wiggled.

69
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:33,293
"Huh? Did the pill just—"

70
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:39,141
But before the Black Wind King could finish speaking, the pill hopped off his hand.

71
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:44,066
It shot into his mouth and slid down his throat.

72
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:48,095
Gulp!
