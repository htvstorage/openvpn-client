00:00:11,266.66699999999946 --> 173:45:11,266.6670000553131
Wukong stood before Guanyin.

2
173:46:51,266.6670000553131 --> 314:23:31,266.6670000553131
He was telling the bodhisattva everything [n@that had happened at the monastery.

3
314:25:11,266.6670000553131 --> 467:08:31,266.6670000553131
"Then a bear spirit called the Black Wind King [n@stole the robe," the monkey went on.

4
467:10:11,266.6670000553131 --> 559:15:11,266.6670000553131
"I demanded he give it back.

5
559:16:51,266.6670000553131 --> 711:50:11,266.66699981689453
We fought—until the bear spirit said it was lunchtime and hid in his cave.

6
711:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 828:36:51,266.66699981689453
I kicked the door and yelled insults at him for more than an hour.

7
828:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 926:46:51,266.66699981689453
[g@But he wouldn't come out.

8
926:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1017:01:51,266.66699981689453
You must help me."@g]

9
1017:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1223:30:11,266.66699981689453
Guanyin sighed. "The Tang Monk should not have [n@shown that robe to the priest," she said.

10
1223:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1313:21:51,266.66699981689453
"The robe is a Buddhist treasure.

11
1313:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1432:13:31,266.66699981689453
When other people see it, they will want it.

12
1432:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1594:01:51,266.66699981689453
And as that head priest tried to do, they might harm the Tang Monk."

13
1594:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1663:11:51,266.66699981689453
"I agree," said Wukong.

14
1663:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1826:18:31,266.66699981689453
"I've told the Tang Monk many times not to do dumb things. But still he—"

15
1826:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2008:56:51,266.66699981689453
"And you should have put out that fire," Guanyin said, interrupting Wukong.

16
2008:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2100:33:31,266.66699981689453
"What you did was terrible!"

17
2100:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2182:35:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong looked at the ground.

18
2182:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2245:28:31,266.66699981689453
[g@He kicked a pebble.

19
2245:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2330:28:31,266.66699981689453
"I know," he mumbled.@g]

20
2330:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2502:45:11,266.66699981689453
"I'll help you get back the robe," said Guanyin. "Let's go."

21
2502:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2631:38:31,266.66699981689453
Wukong and Guanyin soared over the ocean.

22
2631:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2736:05:11,266.66699981689453
Soon they landed on the mountain.

23
2736:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2869:10:11,266.66699981689453
"Where is the Black Wind King's cave?" asked Guanyin.

24
2869:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2933:00:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"It's close," said Wukong.

25
2933:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2987:05:11,266.66699981689453
"We should sneak up to it."@g]

26
2987:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3061:20:11,266.66699981689453
They heard footsteps coming closer.

27
3061:21:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3200:35:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong and Guanyin hid as a Daoist priest walked along the path.

28
3200:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3264:36:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The priest was holding a tray.

29
3264:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3360:33:31,266.66699981689453
A bright purple pill sat on the tray.@g]

30
3360:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3450:25:11,266.66699981689453
[g@The priest was talking to himself.

31
3450:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3530:53:31,266.66699981689453
"This is an exciting day," he said.@g]

32
3530:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3637:46:51,266.66699981689453
"The Black Wind King has a new robe that is a Buddhist treasure.

33
3637:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3712:18:31,266.66699981689453
And I hope he likes the pill I made for him.

34
3712:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3874:55:11,266.66699981689453
It will make him live forever."

35
3874:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4089:55:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong stared at the priest, using his magic sight.

36
4089:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4175:16:51,266.66699981689453
"That's not a priest!" Wukong realized.

37
4175:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4273:56:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"It's a wolf spirit dressed as a priest."

38
4273:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4347:00:11,266.66699981689453
The monkey's eyes lit up.@g]

39
4347:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4457:11:51,266.66699981689453
"I have an idea, Bodhisattva!"

40
4457:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4630:21:51,266.66699981689453
A little while later, the priest stood before [n@the Black Wind King's cave door.

41
4630:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4728:50:11,266.66699981689453
He knocked and the door flew open.

42
4728:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4886:40:11,266.66699981689453
"Are you still here, you little monkey?" shouted the Black Wind King.

43
4886:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4966:30:11,266.66699981689453
[g@Then he saw the priest and smiled.

44
4966:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5039:56:51,266.66699981689453
"Oh, it's you, my old friend!@g]

5218:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5258:33:31,266.66699981689453
[g@He looked around.

48
5258:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5337:30:11,266.66699981689453
"I guess he's gone."@g]

5337:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5454:01:51,266.66699981689453
"A monkey spirit was here?" asked the priest.

50
5454:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5510:50:11,266.66699981689453
"Yes," said the bear.

51
5510:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5611:53:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"He kept banging on my door and yelling at me.

He was very rude."@g]

5710:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5844:20:11,266.66699981689453
The Black Wind King patted the priest on the shoulder.

54
5844:21:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5912:06:51,266.66699981689453

6026:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6092:05:11,266.66699981689453
"I'm well," said the priest.

58
6092:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6208:53:31,266.66699981689453
"I brought you a gift, to celebrate your new Buddhist treasure."

59
6208:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6283:13:31,266.66699981689453
He held up the tray with the pill.

60
6283:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6361:58:31,266.66699981689453
[g@The Black Wind King looked interested.

6362:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6452:18:31,266.66699981689453
"What kind of pill is that?"@g]

"It is a very special pill," said the priest with a smile.

6558:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6609:41:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"I made it just for you.

6681:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6778:35:11,266.66699981689453
The Black Wind King stroked his chin.

66
6778:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6970:38:31,266.66699981689453
"You know, I was just thinking this morning [n@that I would like to live forever."

6970:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7075:55:11,266.66699981689453
The bear picked up the pill and opened his mouth wide.

7075:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7204:15:11,266.66699981689453
As he brought the pill up to his mouth, the pill wiggled.

7204:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7278:30:11,266.66699981689453

7278:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7440:56:51,266.66699981689453
But before the Black Wind King could finish [n@speaking, the pill hopped off his hand.

7440:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7577:45:11,266.66699981689453
It shot into his mouth and slid down his throat.
