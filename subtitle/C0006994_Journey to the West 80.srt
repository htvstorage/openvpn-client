00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 189:20:10,933.3329999446869
One afternoon Wukong and his companions were resting by a stream.

2
189:21:50,933.3329999446869 --> 287:50:10,933.3329999446869
They were eating peaches and berries.

3
287:51:50,933.3329999446869 --> 397:00:10,933.3329999446869
"We must be getting close to the Western Paradise," said the Tang Monk.

4
397:01:50,933.3329999446869 --> 463:56:50,933.3329999446869
"We've been traveling for years."

5
463:58:30,933.3329999446869 --> 612:03:30,933.3330001831055
"I feel like we've been traveling for [i@thousands@i] of years," said Bajie.

6
612:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 712:58:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"We still have a long way to go," said Wukong.

7
713:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 743:08:30,933.3330001831055
"But don't worry.@g]

8
743:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 886:38:30,933.3330001831055
Eventually we'll arrive in the Western Paradise [n@and climb up the Spirit Mountain.

9
886:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1014:21:50,933.3330001831055
Buddha's home, the Thunderclap Monastery, sits halfway up the mountain."

10
1014:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1121:56:50,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk took a bite of his peach.

11
1121:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1241:36:50,933.3330001831055
"The Thunderclap Monastery must be wonderful to see."

12
1241:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1356:20:10,933.3330001831055
"The monastery is spectacular," said the monkey.

13
1356:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1438:35:10,933.3330001831055
"Golden light shines from it."

14
1438:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1515:13:30,933.3330001831055
Bajie moaned.

15
1515:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1620:28:30,933.3330001831055
"So we're going to have to climb a mountain at the end of this journey?

16
1620:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1708:46:50,933.3330001831055
Just thinking about that makes me tired."

17
1708:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1773:08:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wujing stroked his chin.

18
1773:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1873:41:50,933.3330001831055
"I really hope the journey ends soon."@g]

19
1873:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1974:13:30,933.3330001831055
The pig nodded. "You're tired of traveling too?"

20
1974:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2074:28:30,933.3330001831055
"No," said Wujing with a serious look.

21
2074:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2189:33:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm just tired of hearing you complain."

22
2189:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2262:55:10,933.3330001831055
Everyone was quiet for a moment.

23
2262:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2482:25:10,933.3330001831055
Then Wujing's face broke into a smile, and everybody laughed, even Bajie.

24
2482:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2566:48:30,933.3330001831055
"Very funny, Wujing," said Bajie.

25
2566:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2609:35:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk stood up.

26
2609:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2647:13:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"We should go.

27
2647:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2782:45:10,933.3330001831055
I'd like to find a village or a monastery before dark."@g]

28
2782:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2899:36:50,933.3330001831055
A couple of hours later, they were traveling up a mountain road.

29
2899:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3051:25:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The road curved around a bend.

30
3051:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3170:51:50,933.3330001831055
Ahead they could see a small monastery.@g]

31
3170:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3227:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk gasped.

32
3227:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3305:51:50,933.3330001831055
"Is that the Thunderclap Monastery?"@g]

33
3305:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3372:26:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"It might be," said Bajie.

34
3372:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3452:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Golden light is shining from it."@g]

35
3452:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3533:16:50,933.3330001831055
"It's on a mountain," Wujing added.

36
3533:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3598:38:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong laughed.

37
3598:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3682:46:50,933.3330001831055
"It's not the Thunderclap Monastery.@g]

38
3682:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3775:11:50,933.3330001831055
We're not even in the Western Paradise yet."

39
3775:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4001:10:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey peered at the monastery for a moment and then frowned.

40
4001:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4182:05:10,933.3330001831055
"We must be careful—I see dark clouds over the monastery."

41
4182:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4285:05:10,933.3330001831055
The travelers continued walking along the road.

42
4285:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4382:15:10,933.3330001831055
Soon they were standing in front of the monastery.

43
4382:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4538:08:30,933.3330001831055
A sign over the door read: "Small Thunderclap Monastery."

44
4538:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4616:21:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Wukong!" cried the Tang Monk.

45
4616:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4703:35:10,933.3330001831055
"This monastery must belong to Buddha!"@g]

46
4703:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4748:43:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong shook his head.

47
4748:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4799:05:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"It doesn't belong to Buddha.

48
4799:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4891:20:10,933.3330001831055
Let's keep walking."@g]

49
4891:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4956:56:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Hold on," said Bajie.

50
4956:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5039:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Golden light is shining from this monastery.@g]

51
5039:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5129:05:10,933.3330001831055
It must be an important place."

52
5129:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5241:45:10,933.3330001831055
"It's not," said Wukong. "We should really—"

53
5241:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5325:05:10,933.3330001831055
"We're going in," the Tang Monk said.

54
5325:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5380:56:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"This is a Buddhist monastery.

55
5380:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5478:43:30,933.3330001831055
We should visit it."@g]

56
5478:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5570:20:10,933.3330001831055
The monk opened the monastery's door and entered.

57
5570:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5640:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie and Wujing followed.

58
5640:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5838:38:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong sighed and went in after them.@g]

59
5838:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5942:46:50,933.3330001831055
This place was definitely not what it seemed.

60
5942:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6064:56:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey pulled out his iron bar.

61
6064:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6168:26:50,933.3330001831055
The group entered the building's main hall.

62
6168:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6302:28:30,933.3330001831055
A large golden statue of Buddha sat before them.

63
6302:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6408:18:30,933.3330001831055
"Do you see that statue, Wukong?" said the Tang Monk.

64
6408:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6485:48:30,933.3330001831055
"This is a real Buddhist monastery."

65
6485:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6556:31:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Suddenly a voice boomed.

66
6556:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6700:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Who dares to enter without bowing to Buddha?"@g]

67
6700:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6769:05:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk trembled with fear.

68
6769:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6882:03:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Right away, he fell to his knees and bowed.

69
6882:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6952:10:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie and Wujing bowed.@g]

70
6952:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7064:40:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong continued to stand, peering at the statue.

71
7064:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7149:10:10,933.3330001831055
It looked very suspicious.@g]

72
7149:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7261:40:10,933.3330001831055
"Why don't you bow?" the voice asked.

73
7261:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7409:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Wukong!" whispered the Tang Monk. "Show some respect!"

74
7409:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7509:33:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"I won't bow to you!" shouted Wukong.

75
7509:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7578:46:50,933.3330001831055
"I can see that you're really a—"@g]

[i@Clang!@i] Before the monkey could finish yelling, [n@a large pair of cymbals fell from above.

77
7765:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7915:23:30,933.3330001831055
They slammed together, sealing Wukong inside.

78
7915:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7991:36:50,933.3330001831055
"Wukong!" cried the Tang Monk.

7991:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8144:11:50,933.3330001831055
Light flashed, and the statue turned into a demon with yellow eyebrows.

80
8144:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8232:55:10,933.3330001831055
