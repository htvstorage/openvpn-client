00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:17,749
One afternoon Wukong and his companions were resting by a stream.

2
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,295
They were eating peaches and berries.

3
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:25,225
"We must be getting close to the Western Paradise," said the Tang Monk.

4
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:27,635
"We've been traveling for years."

5
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:32,967
"I feel like we've been traveling for [i@thousands@i] of years," said Bajie.

6
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:36,600
[g@"We still have a long way to go," said Wukong.

7
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,686
"But don't worry.@g]

8
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:42,852
Eventually we'll arrive in the Western Paradise [n@and climb up the Spirit Mountain.

9
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:47,450
Buddha's home, the Thunderclap Monastery, sits halfway up the mountain."

10
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:51,323
The Tang Monk took a bite of his peach.

11
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:55,631
"The Thunderclap Monastery must be wonderful to see."

12
00:00:55,632 --> 00:00:59,761
"The monastery is spectacular," said the monkey.

13
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:02,722
"Golden light shines from it."

14
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:05,481
Bajie moaned.

15
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:09,270
"So we're going to have to climb a mountain at the end of this journey?

16
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:12,449
Just thinking about that makes me tired."

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,766
[g@Wujing stroked his chin.

18
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:18,386
"I really hope the journey ends soon."@g]

19
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:22,005
The pig nodded. "You're tired of traveling too?"

20
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:25,614
"No," said Wujing with a serious look.

21
00:01:25,615 --> 00:01:29,757
"I'm just tired of hearing you complain."

22
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:32,398
Everyone was quiet for a moment.

23
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:40,300
Then Wujing's face broke into a smile, and everybody laughed, even Bajie.

24
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:43,338
"Very funny, Wujing," said Bajie.

25
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:44,878
The Tang Monk stood up.

26
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,233
[g@"We should go.

27
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:51,112
I'd like to find a village or a monastery before dark."@g]

28
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:55,319
A couple of hours later, they were traveling up a mountain road.

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,784
[g@The road curved around a bend.

30
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:05,084
Ahead they could see a small monastery.@g]

31
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:07,109
[g@The Tang Monk gasped.

32
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,944
"Is that the Thunderclap Monastery?"@g]

33
00:02:09,945 --> 00:02:12,341
[g@"It might be," said Bajie.

34
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:15,233
"Golden light is shining from it."@g]

35
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:18,131
"It's on a mountain," Wujing added.

36
00:02:18,132 --> 00:02:20,484
[g@Wukong laughed.

37
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:23,513
"It's not the Thunderclap Monastery.@g]

38
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:26,840
We're not even in the Western Paradise yet."

39
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:34,975
The monkey peered at the monastery for a moment and then frowned.

40
00:02:34,976 --> 00:02:41,488
"We must be careful—I see dark clouds over the monastery."

41
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,196
The travelers continued walking along the road.

42
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:48,694
Soon they were standing in front of the monastery.

43
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:54,306
A sign over the door read: "Small Thunderclap Monastery."

44
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,122
[g@"Wukong!" cried the Tang Monk.

45
00:02:57,123 --> 00:03:00,262
"This monastery must belong to Buddha!"@g]

46
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,887
Wukong shook his head.

47
00:03:01,888 --> 00:03:03,700
[g@"It doesn't belong to Buddha.

48
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:07,021
Let's keep walking."@g]

49
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:09,383
[g@"Hold on," said Bajie.

50
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:12,365
"Golden light is shining from this monastery.@g]

51
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:15,580
It must be an important place."

52
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:19,636
"It's not," said Wukong. "We should really—"

53
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:22,636
"We're going in," the Tang Monk said.

54
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,647
[g@"This is a Buddhist monastery.

55
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:28,167
We should visit it."@g]

56
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:31,465
The monk opened the monastery's door and entered.

57
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:33,998
[g@Bajie and Wujing followed.

58
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:41,124
Wukong sighed and went in after them.@g]

59
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,873
This place was definitely not what it seemed.

60
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:49,271
The monkey pulled out his iron bar.

61
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:52,997
The group entered the building's main hall.

62
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:57,822
A large golden statue of Buddha sat before them.

63
00:03:57,823 --> 00:04:01,632
"Do you see that statue, Wukong?" said the Tang Monk.

64
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:04,422
"This is a real Buddhist monastery."

65
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:06,968
[g@Suddenly a voice boomed.

66
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:12,147
"Who dares to enter without bowing to Buddha?"@g]

67
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:14,620
The Tang Monk trembled with fear.

68
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,687
[g@Right away, he fell to his knees and bowed.

69
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:21,211
Bajie and Wujing bowed.@g]

70
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:25,261
[g@Wukong continued to stand, peering at the statue.

71
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:28,303
It looked very suspicious.@g]

72
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:32,353
"Why don't you bow?" the voice asked.

73
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:37,671
"Wukong!" whispered the Tang Monk. "Show some respect!"

74
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:41,277
[g@"I won't bow to you!" shouted Wukong.

75
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:43,769
"I can see that you're really a—"@g]

76
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:50,492
[i@Clang!@i] Before the monkey could finish yelling, [n@a large pair of cymbals fell from above.

77
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:55,887
They slammed together, sealing Wukong inside.

78
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:58,631
"Wukong!" cried the Tang Monk.

79
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:04,124
Light flashed, and the statue turned into a demon with yellow eyebrows.

80
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,318
[g@The demon stood up and smiled.

81
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,593
"The Tang Monk!"@g]
