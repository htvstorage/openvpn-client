00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,126
"I'm hungry," Bajie moaned.

2
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:23,368
[g@His stomach grumbled loudly.

3
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,949
"Can we stop walking?"@g]

4
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,274
"We'll stop for lunch soon," said the Tang Monk.

5
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:32,363
[g@"The weather is nice, and the road is smooth.

6
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:33,897
I want to keep moving.@g]

7
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:37,332
I'm eager to reach the Western Paradise."

8
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,369
[g@Wukong laughed.

9
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,197
"Master, I don't know why you're still going there.@g]

10
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:46,860
You should have married that scorpion spirit instead!"

11
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:48,647
[g@The Tang Monk frowned.

12
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,977
"That's not funny, Wukong."@g]

13
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:54,114
[g@"I agree with Wukong," said Bajie.

14
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:56,945
"I would have gladly married her."@g]

15
00:00:56,946 --> 00:00:59,174
[g@Wujing raised an eyebrow.

16
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:02,121
"I doubt she would have married you."@g]

17
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:05,727
[g@"Why not?" Bajie puffed out his chest.

18
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:08,434
"I'm very handsome!"@g]

19
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:13,936
Everybody laughed, including Bajie.

20
00:01:13,937 --> 00:01:18,738
They had continued for another hour when the pig complained again.

21
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:23,129
"My legs are tired," he said.

22
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,513
"We'll stop at the next village," said the Tang Monk.

23
00:01:27,514 --> 00:01:32,801
Bajie sighed. "I hope we reach the next village soon."

24
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:38,080
"I know how we can get there soon," said Wukong with a laugh.

25
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:42,351
The monkey smacked the horse, which shot forward.

26
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:50,112
"Wukong!" cried the Tang Monk, hanging on tightly.

27
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:56,857
When the horse finally stopped running, the monk [n@was far ahead of his companions.

28
00:01:56,858 --> 00:02:01,180
A group of nasty-looking men stood in front of him.

29
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:05,545
"Give us all your money!" said a man with an ax.

30
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:08,183
The Tang Monk shook with fear.

31
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:10,541
Wukong was already running over.

32
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:17,846
"Don't you dare harm my master!" shouted the monkey.

33
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:20,879
"Who are you?" asked the man.

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,874
"My name is Sun Wukong."

35
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:31,539
"Give me your money, Sun Wukong," said the man.

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,313
[g@"I don't have much money," said the monkey.

37
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:37,763
"You'd better give me yours."@g]

38
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:39,883
[g@The man's face turned red.

39
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:43,133
"I'm not going to give you money!"@g]

40
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:46,272
"Let's make a bet then," said Wukong.

41
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:51,015
He pulled out his iron bar, which quickly grew to the height of a person.

42
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:53,307
The men looked nervous.

43
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:56,710
The monkey stood the bar on the ground.

44
00:02:56,711 --> 00:03:01,056
"If you can pick this up, we'll give you all of our money."

45
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:04,789
[g@"You're a fool," said the man with an ax.

46
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,043
"I'm sure I can pick that bar up."@g]

47
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:11,455
"Go ahead and try," said Wukong.

48
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:14,160
The man put down the ax.

49
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:20,043
He grasped the bar with his hands and tried to lift it.

50
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:23,392
"It's heavier than it looks," said the man.

51
00:03:23,393 --> 00:03:26,057
[g@He tried to lift the bar again.

52
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:28,575
Sweat poured down his red face.@g]

53
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,789
But the bar didn't budge.

54
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,856
"Now it's my turn!" said Wukong.

55
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:39,202
He lifted the bar over his head and twirled it around.

56
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:41,435
[g@His eyes flashed with anger.

57
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:44,870
He got ready to strike the man.@g]

58
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:49,485
"Wukong, don't!" shouted the Tang Monk.

59
00:03:49,486 --> 00:03:52,066
The man took a step back.

60
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:55,520
Suddenly the bar dropped from Wukong's hands.

61
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:59,548
"Aargh!" cried the monkey, holding his head.

62
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:05,294
He fell to his knees as the Tang Monk quietly [n@recited the Tight Headband spell.

63
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:09,331
The robbers glanced at one another and then ran away.

64
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:13,992
When the monk stopped reciting the spell, Wukong was furious.

65
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:16,868
[g@"Why did you do that?" he cried.

66
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:18,884
"They were going toâ€”"@g]

67
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:22,798
"You must not hurt people!" commanded the monk.

68
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:27,881
"I destroy demons all the time," said the monkey.

69
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:30,185
[g@"It's fine to hurt demons.

70
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,103
But you must not hurt [i@people.@i]"@g]

71
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:35,309
[g@The monk sighed.

72
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,839
"You're still evil, Wukong.@g]

73
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,448
[g@I can't bring you to the Western Paradise.

74
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:45,865
You must leave."@g]

75
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:50,539
[g@"But you need me, Master!" Wukong insisted.

76
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,713
"I refuse to leave."@g]

77
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:56,273
"Go!" said the Tang Monk.

78
00:04:56,274 --> 00:05:02,216
"Or I'll recite the Tight Headband spell until your head explodes!"

79
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:06,571
Wukong could see that the monk wasn't going to change his mind.

80
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:17,121
With tears in his eyes, the monkey leaped into the air and was gone.
