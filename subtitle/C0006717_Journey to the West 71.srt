00:00:11,000 --> 253:30:11,000
"I'm hungry," Bajie moaned.

2
253:31:51,000 --> 343:33:31,000
[g@His stomach grumbled loudly.

3
343:35:11,000 --> 415:15:11,000
"Can we stop walking?"@g]

4
415:16:51,000 --> 507:36:51,000
"We'll stop for lunch soon," said the Tang Monk.

5
507:38:31,000 --> 593:25:11,000
[g@"The weather is nice, and the road is smooth.

6
593:26:51,000 --> 636:01:51,000
I want to keep moving.@g]

7
636:03:31,000 --> 731:26:51,000
I'm eager to reach the Western Paradise."

8
731:28:31,000 --> 788:01:51,000
[g@Wukong laughed.

9
788:03:31,000 --> 894:21:51,000
"Master, I don't know why you're still going there.@g]

10
894:23:31,000 --> 996:06:51,000
You should have married that scorpion spirit instead!"

11
996:08:31,000 --> 1045:45:11,000
[g@The Tang Monk frowned.

12
1045:46:51,000 --> 1110:28:31,000
"That's not funny, Wukong."@g]

13
1110:30:11,000 --> 1197:36:51,000
[g@"I agree with Wukong," said Bajie.

14
1197:38:31,000 --> 1276:15:11,000
"I would have gladly married her."@g]

15
1276:16:51,000 --> 1338:10:11,000
[g@Wujing raised an eyebrow.

16
1338:11:51,000 --> 1420:01:51,000
"I doubt she would have married you."@g]

17
1420:03:31,000 --> 1520:11:51,000
[g@"Why not?" Bajie puffed out his chest.

18
1520:13:31,000 --> 1595:23:31,000
"I'm very handsome!"@g]

19
1595:25:11,000 --> 1748:13:31,000
Everybody laughed, including Bajie.

20
1748:15:11,000 --> 1881:36:51,000
They had continued for another hour when the pig complained again.

21
1881:38:31,000 --> 2003:35:11,000
"My legs are tired," he said.

22
2003:36:51,000 --> 2125:21:51,000
"We'll stop at the next village," said the Tang Monk.

23
2125:23:31,000 --> 2272:15:11,000
Bajie sighed. "I hope we reach the next village soon."

24
2272:16:51,000 --> 2418:53:31,000
"I know how we can get there soon," said Wukong with a laugh.

25
2418:55:11,000 --> 2537:31:51,000
The monkey smacked the horse, which shot forward.

26
2537:33:31,000 --> 2753:06:51,000
"Wukong!" cried the Tang Monk, hanging on tightly.

27
2753:08:31,000 --> 2940:28:31,000
When the horse finally stopped running, the monk [n@was far ahead of his companions.

28
2940:30:11,000 --> 3060:33:31,000
A group of nasty-looking men stood in front of him.

29
3060:35:11,000 --> 3181:48:31,000
"Give us all your money!" said a man with an ax.

30
3181:50:11,000 --> 3255:05:11,000
The Tang Monk shook with fear.

31
3255:06:51,000 --> 3320:35:11,000
Wukong was already running over.

32
3320:36:51,000 --> 3523:30:11,000
"Don't you dare harm my master!" shouted the monkey.

33
3523:31:51,000 --> 3607:45:11,000
"Who are you?" asked the man.

34
3607:46:51,000 --> 3746:30:11,000
"My name is Sun Wukong."

35
3746:31:51,000 --> 3903:51:51,000
"Give me your money, Sun Wukong," said the man.

36
3903:53:31,000 --> 3980:55:11,000
[g@"I don't have much money," said the monkey.

37
3980:56:51,000 --> 4076:45:11,000
"You'd better give me yours."@g]

38
4076:46:51,000 --> 4135:38:31,000
[g@The man's face turned red.

39
4135:40:11,000 --> 4225:55:11,000
"I'm not going to give you money!"@g]

40
4225:56:51,000 --> 4313:06:51,000
"Let's make a bet then," said Wukong.

41
4313:08:31,000 --> 4444:51:51,000
He pulled out his iron bar, which quickly grew to the height of a person.

42
4444:53:31,000 --> 4508:31:51,000
The men looked nervous.

43
4508:33:31,000 --> 4603:03:31,000
The monkey stood the bar on the ground.

44
4603:05:11,000 --> 4723:46:51,000
"If you can pick this up, we'll give you all of our money."

45
4723:48:31,000 --> 4827:28:31,000
[g@"You're a fool," said the man with an ax.

46
4827:30:11,000 --> 4917:51:51,000
"I'm sure I can pick that bar up."@g]

47
4917:53:31,000 --> 5012:38:31,000
"Go ahead and try," said Wukong.

48
5012:40:11,000 --> 5087:46:51,000
The man put down the ax.

49
5087:48:31,000 --> 5251:11:51,000
He grasped the bar with his hands and tried to lift it.

50
5251:13:31,000 --> 5344:13:31,000
"It's heavier than it looks," said the man.

51
5344:15:11,000 --> 5418:15:11,000
[g@He tried to lift the bar again.

52
5418:16:51,000 --> 5488:11:51,000
Sweat poured down his red face.@g]

53
5488:13:31,000 --> 5577:28:31,000
But the bar didn't budge.

54
5577:30:11,000 --> 5662:40:11,000
"Now it's my turn!" said Wukong.

55
5662:41:51,000 --> 5783:23:31,000
He lifted the bar over his head and twirled it around.

56
5783:25:11,000 --> 5845:25:11,000
[g@His eyes flashed with anger.

57
5845:26:51,000 --> 5940:50:11,000
He got ready to strike the man.@g]

58
5940:51:51,000 --> 6069:01:51,000
"Wukong, don't!" shouted the Tang Monk.

59
6069:03:31,000 --> 6140:43:31,000
The man took a step back.

60
6140:45:11,000 --> 6236:40:11,000
Suddenly the bar dropped from Wukong's hands.

61
6236:41:51,000 --> 6348:33:31,000
"Aargh!" cried the monkey, holding his head.

62
6348:35:11,000 --> 6508:10:11,000
He fell to his knees as the Tang Monk quietly [n@recited the Tight Headband spell.

63
6508:11:51,000 --> 6620:18:31,000
The robbers glanced at one another and then ran away.

64
6620:20:11,000 --> 6749:46:51,000
When the monk stopped reciting the spell, Wukong was furious.

65
6749:48:31,000 --> 6829:40:11,000
[g@"Why did you do that?" he cried.

66
6829:41:51,000 --> 6885:40:11,000
"They were going toâ€”"@g]

67
6885:41:51,000 --> 6994:23:31,000
"You must not hurt people!" commanded the monk.

68
6994:25:11,000 --> 7135:35:11,000
"I destroy demons all the time," said the monkey.

69
7135:36:51,000 --> 7199:35:11,000
[g@"It's fine to hurt demons.

70
7199:36:51,000 --> 7280:38:31,000
But you must not hurt [i@people.@i]"@g]

71
7280:40:11,000 --> 7341:55:11,000
[g@The monk sighed.

72
7341:56:51,000 --> 7412:11:51,000
"You're still evil, Wukong.@g]

73
7412:13:31,000 --> 7512:26:51,000
[g@I can't bring you to the Western Paradise.

74
7512:28:31,000 --> 7635:08:31,000
You must leave."@g]

75
7635:10:11,000 --> 7764:58:31,000
[g@"But you need me, Master!" Wukong insisted.

76
7765:00:11,000 --> 7853:08:31,000
"I refuse to leave."@g]

77
7853:10:11,000 --> 7924:15:11,000
"Go!" said the Tang Monk.

78
7924:16:51,000 --> 8089:20:11,000
"Or I'll recite the Tight Headband spell until your head explodes!"

79
8089:21:51,000 --> 8210:18:31,000
Wukong could see that the monk wasn't going to change his mind.

80
8210:20:11,000 --> 8503:21:51,000
With tears in his eyes, the monkey leaped into the air and was gone.
