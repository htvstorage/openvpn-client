1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:16,056
The lion demon rubbed his aching mouth.

2
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:19,266
[g@"Let's leave the Tang Monk alone.

3
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:22,332
Wukong is dangerous."@g]

4
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,262
The raptor nodded.

5
00:00:24,263 --> 00:00:27,710
"Bah!" The elephant demon waved his hand.

6
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:31,041
"I'm not afraid of that silly monkey.

7
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:36,417
I have a perfect plan to defeat him and capture the Tang Monk."

8
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:38,278
The lion shook his head.

9
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:45,453
"The last time you had a plan, I wound up with a broken tooth."

10
00:00:45,454 --> 00:00:47,285
[g@The elephant snorted.

11
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:51,982
"Just leave everything to me."@g]

12
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:55,220
[g@Wukong returned to his companions.

13
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,519
He heard Bajie and Wujing arguing.@g]

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,875
[g@"We can't go home!" shouted Wujing.

15
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:05,060
"We're on an important journey."@g]

16
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:10,405
"But Wukong got eaten by the lion demon," said Bajie.

17
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:15,290
"Without Wukong, we'll never get to the Western Paradise."

18
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,792
"Here I am!" said the monkey.

19
00:01:17,793 --> 00:01:20,408
Everyone spun around.

20
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:23,681
"You're alive!" cried the Tang Monk.

21
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:26,548
"Yes, I am," said Wukong.

22
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,133
"I beat up that lion's insides and broke one of his teeth.

23
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:32,514
The demons are scared of me now.

24
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:36,020
They promised to let us cross their mountain safely."

25
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:40,055
"That's wonderful," said the Tang Monk.

26
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:43,369
Wujing helped the monk climb onto the horse.

27
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,701
The other travelers started walking.

28
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:53,607
They hadn't gone far when they saw a large figure ahead, blocking the road.

29
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:57,705
"That's the elephant demon," said Wukong with a frown.

30
00:01:57,706 --> 00:01:59,896
"What's he doing here?"

31
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:04,871
"We want the Tang Monk!" shouted the elephant.

32
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:07,258
The Tang Monk fainted.

33
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,654
[g@Wukong turned to Bajie.

34
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:13,336
"I've been dealing with these demons all day.@g]

35
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:16,805
It's your turn to fight them."

36
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:18,317
[g@Bajie sighed.

37
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,813
"Okay." Waving his rake, the pig charged toward the elephant.@g]

38
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:27,594
"You'll never harm my master!"

39
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:32,134
The elephant blocked the rake, spun around, and struck back.

40
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:35,064
Bajie jumped out of the way.

41
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:40,102
The elephant jerked his head, and his trunk shot out.

42
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:44,859
Before Bajie could duck, the trunk wrapped tightly around his body.

43
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,734
As the elephant ran off with Bajie, Wukong groaned.

44
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:53,134
The monkey turned to his companions.

45
00:02:53,135 --> 00:02:54,493
[g@"You two wait here.

46
00:02:54,494 --> 00:03:00,169
I'll go save the pig."@g]

47
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:07,749
Wukong returned to the demons' cave and turned into a fly.

48
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,309
He found Bajie deep inside the cave.

49
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,223
The pig was tied up, floating in a tub of salt water.

50
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:22,461
Wukong changed back into himself and untied his companion.

51
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:24,668
[g@"Thank you," said Bajie.

52
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:28,071
"Those demons were planning to pickle me!"@g]

53
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:31,055
[g@"You're welcome, Bajie," said Wukong.

54
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:33,325
"Now let's—whaa!"@g]

55
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:37,239
The elephant's trunk wrapped tightly around Wukong's chest.

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,480
Then the elephant stepped out of a dark corner.

57
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:44,539
"I knew you'd come to save your friend," said the elephant.

58
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,224
[g@"Now you can't protect the Tang Monk.

59
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:50,560
My trunk is very strong!"@g]

60
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:53,221
Wukong's arms were still free.

61
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:56,678
He pulled out his iron bar, which instantly grew.

62
00:03:56,679 --> 00:04:01,271
With all his strength, he slammed it down on the elephant's trunk.

63
00:04:01,272 --> 00:04:04,883
[g@"Ow! Ow! Ow!" the elephant cried.

64
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:07,794
He released Wukong and fell backward.@g]

65
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:11,409
His trunk had a horrible purple bruise.

66
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:16,241
Wukong moved toward the elephant, his iron bar raised high.

67
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:19,487
The elephant's eyes went wide.

68
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:21,610
[g@"Please don't hurt me anymore!

69
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:25,001
We'll let the Tang Monk cross the mountain!"@g]

70
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:28,082
The monkey glared at the elephant for a moment.

71
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,612
[g@Then he put the iron bar away.

72
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:34,215
"You'd better not trick us again."@g]

73
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:40,280
Wukong and Bajie left the cave and returned to their companions.

74
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:43,070
The group continued over the mountain.

75
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:48,095
As the travelers came around a bend, they saw the lion and the elephant.

76
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:52,997
The two demons were blocking the road.

77
00:04:52,998 --> 00:04:58,045
[g@Wukong stomped toward them.

78
00:04:58,046 --> 00:04:59,737
"What are you doing?

79
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:01,010
You promised to—"@g]

80
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:04,054
"Wukong, help us!" cried the Tang Monk.

81
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,171
Wukong spun around.

82
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:10,491
The raptor had grabbed the monkey's companions with its talons.

83
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:20,929
With a powerful flap of its wings, the giant bird flew away.
