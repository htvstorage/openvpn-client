231:30:10,933.3329999446869 --> 316:38:30,933.3329999446869
Wukong is dangerous."@g]

4
316:40:10,933.3329999446869 --> 370:15:10,933.3329999446869
The raptor nodded.

5
370:16:50,933.3329999446869 --> 466:01:50,933.3329999446869
"Bah!" The elephant demon waved his hand.

6
466:03:30,933.3329999446869 --> 558:33:30,933.3329999446869
"I'm not afraid of that silly monkey.

7
558:35:10,933.3329999446869 --> 707:53:30,933.3330001831055
I have a perfect plan to defeat him and capture the Tang Monk."

8
707:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 759:35:10,933.3330001831055
The lion shook his head.

9
759:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 958:53:30,933.3330001831055
"The last time you had a plan, I wound up with a broken tooth."

10
958:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1009:46:50,933.3330001831055

1009:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1140:15:10,933.3330001831055
"Just leave everything to me."@g]

1140:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1230:11:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong returned to his companions.

13
1230:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1321:50:10,933.3330001831055
He heard Bajie and Wujing arguing.@g]

1321:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1415:03:30,933.3330001831055

1415:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1503:31:50,933.3330001831055
"We're on an important journey."@g]

1503:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1652:00:10,933.3330001831055
"But Wukong got eaten by the lion demon," said Bajie.

17
1652:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1787:41:50,933.3330001831055
"Without Wukong, we'll never get to the Western Paradise."

18
1787:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1857:11:50,933.3330001831055
"Here I am!" said the monkey.

19
1857:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1929:51:50,933.3330001831055
Everyone spun around.

20
1929:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2020:46:50,933.3330001831055
"You're alive!" cried the Tang Monk.

21
2020:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2100:25:10,933.3330001831055
"Yes, I am," said Wukong.

22
2100:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2200:00:10,933.3330001831055
"I beat up that lion's insides and broke one of his teeth.

2200:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2266:08:30,933.3330001831055
The demons are scared of me now.

24
2266:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2363:31:50,933.3330001831055
They promised to let us cross their mountain safely."

25
2363:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2475:36:50,933.3330001831055
"That's wonderful," said the Tang Monk.

26
2475:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2567:40:10,933.3330001831055
Wujing helped the monk climb onto the horse.

27
2567:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2660:13:30,933.3330001831055
The other travelers started walking.

28
2660:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2852:03:30,933.3330001831055
They hadn't gone far when they saw a large figure ahead, blocking the road.

29
2852:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2965:53:30,933.3330001831055
"That's the elephant demon," said Wukong with a frown.

30
2965:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3026:45:10,933.3330001831055
"What's he doing here?"

31
3026:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3164:56:50,933.3330001831055
"We want the Tang Monk!" shouted the elephant.

32
3164:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3231:15:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk fainted.

33
3231:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3297:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong turned to Bajie.

34
3297:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3400:05:10,933.3330001831055
"I've been dealing with these demons all day.@g]

35
3400:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3496:26:50,933.3330001831055
It's your turn to fight them."

36
3496:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3538:26:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie sighed.

37
3538:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3691:06:50,933.3330001831055
"Okay." Waving his rake, the pig charged toward the elephant.@g]

38
3691:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3796:08:30,933.3330001831055
"You'll never harm my master!"

39
3796:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3922:15:10,933.3330001831055
The elephant blocked the rake, spun around, and struck back.

40
3922:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4003:38:30,933.3330001831055
Bajie jumped out of the way.

41
4003:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4143:35:10,933.3330001831055
The elephant jerked his head, and his trunk shot out.

42
4143:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4275:43:30,933.3330001831055
Before Bajie could duck, the trunk wrapped tightly around his body.

43
4275:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4438:55:10,933.3330001831055
As the elephant ran off with Bajie, Wukong groaned.

44
4438:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4505:35:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey turned to his companions.

45
4505:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4543:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"You two wait here.

4543:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4701:00:10,933.3330001831055
I'll go save the pig."@g]

47
4701:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4911:33:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong returned to the demons' cave and turned into a fly.

48
4911:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5010:26:50,933.3330001831055
He found Bajie deep inside the cave.

49
5010:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5146:56:50,933.3330001831055
The pig was tied up, floating in a tub of salt water.

50
5146:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5320:13:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong changed back into himself and untied his companion.

51
5320:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5381:31:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Thank you," said Bajie.

52
5381:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5476:03:30,933.3330001831055
"Those demons were planning to pickle me!"@g]

53
5476:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5558:56:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"You're welcome, Bajie," said Wukong.

54
5558:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5622:00:10,933.3330001831055
"Now let's—whaa!"@g]

55
5622:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5730:43:30,933.3330001831055
The elephant's trunk wrapped tightly around Wukong's chest.

56
5730:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5820:45:10,933.3330001831055
Then the elephant stepped out of a dark corner.

57
5820:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5933:30:10,933.3330001831055
"I knew you'd come to save your friend," said the elephant.

58
5933:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6008:05:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Now you can't protect the Tang Monk.

6008:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6100:45:10,933.3330001831055
My trunk is very strong!"@g]

60
6100:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6174:40:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong's arms were still free.

61
6174:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6270:41:50,933.3330001831055
He pulled out his iron bar, which instantly grew.

62
6270:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6398:16:50,933.3330001831055
With all his strength, he slammed it down on the elephant's trunk.

63
6398:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6498:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Ow! Ow! Ow!" the elephant cried.

64
6498:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6579:28:30,933.3330001831055
He released Wukong and fell backward.@g]

65
6579:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6679:53:30,933.3330001831055
His trunk had a horrible purple bruise.

66
6679:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6814:06:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong moved toward the elephant, his iron bar raised high.

67
6814:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6904:16:50,933.3330001831055
The elephant's eyes went wide.

68
6904:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6963:15:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Please don't hurt me anymore!

7057:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7143:01:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey glared at the elephant for a moment.

71
7143:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7213:18:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Then he put the iron bar away.

72
7213:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7313:23:30,933.3330001831055
"You'd better not trick us again."@g]

73
7313:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7481:51:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong and Bajie left the cave and returned to their companions.

74
7481:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7559:21:50,933.3330001831055
The group continued over the mountain.

75
7559:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7698:56:50,933.3330001831055
As the travelers came around a bend, they saw the lion and the elephant.

76
7698:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7835:06:50,933.3330001831055
The two demons were blocking the road.

77
7835:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7975:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong stomped toward them.

7975:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8022:20:10,933.3330001831055
"What are you doing?

8022:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8057:41:50,933.3330001831055
You promised to—"@g]

8057:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8142:15:10,933.3330001831055
"Wukong, help us!" cried the Tang Monk.

81
8142:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8201:03:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong spun around.

82
8201:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8321:03:30,933.3330001831055
The raptor had grabbed the monkey's companions with its talons.

83
8321:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8611:00:10,933.3330001831055
With a powerful flap of its wings, the giant bird flew away.
