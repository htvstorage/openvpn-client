1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:18,880
For over a day, the wind from the fan carried Wukong.

2
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:25,117
When he finally landed, he was far from the Iron Immortal's mountain.

3
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,780
[g@Wukong looked around and saw a mountain nearby.

4
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:30,755
It looked familiar.@g]

5
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:33,749
[g@"Mount Sumeru!" said Wukong.

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,269
"The bodhisattva Lingji lives there.@g]

7
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,243
Maybe he can help me deal with the Iron Immortal.

8
00:00:39,244 --> 00:00:45,131
He was able to stop the great king Yellow Wind's wind magic."

9
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:49,845
The monkey went to Lingji's pagoda.

10
00:00:49,846 --> 00:00:52,956
The bodhisattva was sitting in his garden.

11
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:56,933
"Greetings, Bodhisattva," said Wukong.

12
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:59,727
"Hello, Wukong," said Lingji.

13
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:01,750
[g@"It's good to see you again.

14
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:05,777
I was just about to have tea."@g]

15
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:09,846
Wukong and Lingji sat outside, drinking tea.

16
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:15,020
The monkey told the bodhisattva everything that [n@had happened with the Iron Immortal.

17
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:19,947
The bodhisattva handed a small stone to Wukong.

18
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:22,558
"Keep this magic stone in your pocket.

19
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:26,183
It will stop the wind from blowing you away."

20
00:01:26,184 --> 00:01:29,621
"Thank you, Bodhisattva," said the monkey.

21
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:33,648
"Would you like to stay for lunch?" asked Lingji.

22
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:36,232
[g@"No, thank you," said Wukong.

23
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:39,029
"I must get back to my companions.@g]

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,885
I need to get that fan from the Iron Immortal so we can continue west."

25
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:49,413
Wukong returned to the Iron Immortal's cave door.

26
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:56,817
"Open up!" he shouted. "I need your fan!"

27
00:01:56,818 --> 00:02:00,764
The Iron Immortal came out and wrinkled her nose.

28
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:02,926
[g@"I thought I got rid of you."

29
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:05,369
She raised her fan.@g]

30
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,966
"I'll just have to wave harder this time!"

31
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:12,864
The woman waved the fan furiously.

32
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:16,386
[g@A terrible wind blew past Wukong.

33
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:20,078
But the monkey didn't move.@g]

34
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:23,021
[g@The Iron Immortal's eyes burned with anger.

35
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:25,431
"How did you—"@g]

36
00:02:25,432 --> 00:02:29,923
"The bodhisattva Lingji gave me a magic stone," said Wukong.

37
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:33,498
"Your fan can't blow me away now."

38
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:36,358
[g@The monkey pulled out his iron bar.

39
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:38,328
"Now give me that fan!"@g]

40
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:41,566
The Iron Immortal shot back into her cave.

41
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:46,612
Before she could shut the door, Wukong turned into a cricket.

42
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:49,353
He quickly leaped into the cave.

43
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:57,653
Silently he followed the Iron Immortal along a tunnel.

44
00:02:57,654 --> 00:03:01,207
When the woman reached a room, she sat down.

45
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,372
She tucked the fan into her robe.

46
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:08,852
"Wukong is a horrible monkey!" she said to herself.

47
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:12,777
"He forced my poor baby, Red Boy, to become good.

48
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:16,507
Then he demanded to borrow my precious fan!"

49
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:19,656
The Iron Immortal reached for a cup of water.

50
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,706
As she took a drink, Wukong leaped into the cup.

51
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:25,484
[i@Gulp!@i]

52
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:32,153
Inside the Iron Immortal's stomach, Wukong changed back into himself.

53
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:35,617
[g@[i@Boomph! Pow! Boomph! Pow!@i]

54
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:38,657
The monkey punched and kicked.@g]

55
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:41,860
The Iron Immortal fell to her knees.

56
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:45,189
[g@"Ahh! What was in that water?

57
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,637
I feel awful!"@g]

58
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:50,529
[g@"It was me!" shouted Wukong.

59
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,648
"I'm in your stomach now!@g]

60
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:57,121
And I won't stop punching and kicking until you give me that fan!"

61
00:03:57,122 --> 00:03:59,546
[i@Boomph! Pow!@i]

62
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:02,797
"Please stop!" cried the Iron Immortal.

63
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:04,734
[g@"You can have the fan.

64
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:07,468
Just don't hurt me anymore!"@g]

65
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:12,504
Wukong leaped out through the woman's nose and returned to his normal size.

66
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:16,342
"Give me the fan!" he demanded.

67
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:19,416
The Iron Immortal climbed back to her feet.

68
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:22,637
[g@She reached into her robe and pulled out a fan.

69
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:27,750
"Here, take it. Now leave!"@g]

70
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:31,557
Wukong found his companions in the village with the old man.

71
00:04:31,558 --> 00:04:36,564
The monkey explained how he'd tricked the Iron Immortal.

72
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:38,996
[g@"Wonderful!" said the Tang Monk.

73
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:42,507
"Now we can continue our journey."@g]

74
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:48,079
They all thanked the old man and then headed west.

75
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,630
They came to the top of a hill and saw the Mountain of Flames.

76
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:56,119
Fire covered all the land around it.

77
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,834
"Watch this," said Wukong.

78
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:02,707
The monkey waved the fan hard. [i@Whoosh!@i]

79
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:06,754
A strong wind blew toward the mountain.

80
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:10,383
Wukong smiled. "In a moment, we'll—"

81
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:20,654
Suddenly there was a roar as the flames grew bigger, filling the sky!
