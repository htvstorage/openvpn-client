00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 220:45:10,933.3329999446869
For over a day, the wind from the fan carried Wukong.

2
220:46:50,933.3329999446869 --> 394:00:10,933.3329999446869
When he finally landed, he was far from the Iron Immortal's mountain.

3
394:01:50,933.3329999446869 --> 495:45:10,933.3329999446869
[g@Wukong looked around and saw a mountain nearby.

4
495:46:50,933.3329999446869 --> 550:36:50,933.3329999446869
It looked familiar.@g]

5
550:38:30,933.3329999446869 --> 633:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Mount Sumeru!" said Wukong.

6
633:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 703:46:50,933.3330001831055
"The bodhisattva Lingji lives there.@g]

7
703:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 786:23:30,933.3330001831055
Maybe he can help me deal with the Iron Immortal.

8
786:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 949:56:50,933.3330001831055
He was able to stop the great king Yellow Wind's wind magic."

9
949:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1080:53:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey went to Lingji's pagoda.

10
1080:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1167:18:30,933.3330001831055
The bodhisattva was sitting in his garden.

11
1167:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1277:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Greetings, Bodhisattva," said Wukong.

12
1277:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1355:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Hello, Wukong," said Lingji.

13
1355:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1411:35:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"It's good to see you again.

14
1411:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1523:26:50,933.3330001831055
I was just about to have tea."@g]

15
1523:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1636:28:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong and Lingji sat outside, drinking tea.

16
1636:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1780:11:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey told the bodhisattva everything that [n@had happened with the Iron Immortal.

17
1780:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1917:03:30,933.3330001831055
The bodhisattva handed a small stone to Wukong.

18
1917:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1989:35:10,933.3330001831055
"Keep this magic stone in your pocket.

19
1989:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2090:16:50,933.3330001831055
It will stop the wind from blowing you away."

20
2090:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2185:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Thank you, Bodhisattva," said the monkey.

21
2185:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2297:38:30,933.3330001831055
"Would you like to stay for lunch?" asked Lingji.

22
2297:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2369:25:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"No, thank you," said Wukong.

23
2369:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2447:06:50,933.3330001831055
"I must get back to my companions.@g]

24
2447:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2582:00:10,933.3330001831055
I need to get that fan from the Iron Immortal so we can continue west."

25
2582:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2735:33:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong returned to the Iron Immortal's cave door.

26
2735:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2941:13:30,933.3330001831055
"Open up!" he shouted. "I need your fan!"

27
2941:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3050:51:50,933.3330001831055
The Iron Immortal came out and wrinkled her nose.

28
3050:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3110:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"I thought I got rid of you."

29
3110:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3178:46:50,933.3330001831055
She raised her fan.@g]

30
3178:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3278:41:50,933.3330001831055
"I'll just have to wave harder this time!"

31
3278:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3386:58:30,933.3330001831055
The woman waved the fan furiously.

32
3387:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3484:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@A terrible wind blew past Wukong.

33
3484:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3587:21:50,933.3330001831055
But the monkey didn't move.@g]

34
3587:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3669:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The Iron Immortal's eyes burned with anger.

35
3669:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3736:03:30,933.3330001831055
"How did you—"@g]

36
3736:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3860:50:10,933.3330001831055
"The bodhisattva Lingji gave me a magic stone," said Wukong.

37
3860:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3960:08:30,933.3330001831055
"Your fan can't blow me away now."

38
3960:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4039:35:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The monkey pulled out his iron bar.

39
4039:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4094:18:30,933.3330001831055
"Now give me that fan!"@g]

40
4094:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4184:15:10,933.3330001831055
The Iron Immortal shot back into her cave.

41
4184:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4324:25:10,933.3330001831055
Before she could shut the door, Wukong turned into a cricket.

42
4324:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4400:33:30,933.3330001831055
He quickly leaped into the cave.

43
4400:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4631:06:50,933.3330001831055
Silently he followed the Iron Immortal along a tunnel.

44
4631:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4729:50:10,933.3330001831055
When the woman reached a room, she sat down.

45
4729:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4817:45:10,933.3330001831055
She tucked the fan into her robe.

46
4817:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4942:11:50,933.3330001831055
"Wukong is a horrible monkey!" she said to herself.

47
4942:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5051:13:30,933.3330001831055
"He forced my poor baby, Red Boy, to become good.

48
5051:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5154:50:10,933.3330001831055
Then he demanded to borrow my precious fan!"

49
5154:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5242:18:30,933.3330001831055
The Iron Immortal reached for a cup of water.

50
5242:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5354:48:30,933.3330001831055
As she took a drink, Wukong leaped into the cup.

51
5354:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5404:11:50,933.3330001831055
[i@Gulp!@i]

5404:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5589:26:50,933.3330001831055
Inside the Iron Immortal's stomach, Wukong changed back into himself.

53
5589:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5685:40:10,933.3330001831055

5685:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5770:06:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey punched and kicked.@g]

5770:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5859:05:10,933.3330001831055
The Iron Immortal fell to her knees.

56
5859:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5951:33:30,933.3330001831055

"I'm in your stomach now!@g]

6158:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6283:00:10,933.3330001831055
And I won't stop punching and kicking until you give me that fan!"

61
6283:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6350:21:50,933.3330001831055

"Please stop!" cried the Iron Immortal.

6570:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6710:18:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong leaped out through the woman's nose and returned to his normal size.

66
6710:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6816:55:10,933.3330001831055
"Give me the fan!" he demanded.

6816:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6902:18:30,933.3330001831055
The Iron Immortal climbed back to her feet.

6902:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6991:46:50,933.3330001831055

7133:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7239:33:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong found his companions in the village with the old man.

7239:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7378:38:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey explained how he'd tricked the Iron Immortal.

7446:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7543:43:30,933.3330001831055
"Now we can continue our journey."@g]

7543:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7698:30:10,933.3330001831055
They all thanked the old man and then headed west.

75
7698:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7824:55:10,933.3330001831055
They came to the top of a hill and saw the Mountain of Flames.

76
7824:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7921:50:10,933.3330001831055
Fire covered all the land around it.

7921:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7997:15:10,933.3330001831055
"Watch this," said Wukong.

7997:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8104:50:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey waved the fan hard. [i@Whoosh!@i]

8104:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8217:15:10,933.3330001831055
A strong wind blew toward the mountain.

80
8217:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8318:03:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong smiled. "In a moment, we'll—"

8318:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8603:21:50,933.3330001831055
Suddenly there was a roar as the flames grew bigger, filling the sky!
