1
00:00:11,000 --> 96:16:51,000
The Tang Monk glared at Wukong.

2
96:18:31,000 --> 223:11:51,000
"Bajie says you can bring the king back to life," said the monk.

3
223:13:31,000 --> 332:36:51,000
"Please do so now."

4
332:38:31,000 --> 471:20:11,000
Wukong shot a look at Bajie, who was trying not to laugh.

5
471:21:51,000 --> 600:01:51,000
"Master, use the Tight Headband spell!" said the pig.

6
600:03:31,000 --> 717:05:11,000
"Don't!" cried Wukong. "I'll ask Laozi for help.

7
717:06:51,000 --> 796:28:31,000
He makes pills that can make people live forever.

8
796:30:11,000 --> 981:15:11,000
Maybe he makes pills that can bring people back to life."

9
981:16:51,000 --> 1066:36:51,000
[g@Laozi was busy working on a potion.

10
1066:38:31,000 --> 1190:48:31,000
Steam rose from the bubbling cauldron.@g]

11
1190:50:11,000 --> 1402:10:11,000
Suddenly Wukong burst into the room. "Hello, Laozi!"

12
1402:11:51,000 --> 1510:16:51,000
Laozi groaned. "What are you doing here, Wukong?

13
1510:18:31,000 --> 1651:20:11,000
You're supposed to be helping the Tang Monk reach the Western Paradise."

14
1651:21:51,000 --> 1789:20:11,000
Wukong walked around the room, looking at all the bottles and equipment.

15
1789:21:51,000 --> 1876:21:51,000
"I'm still helping the Tang Monk," he said.

16
1876:23:31,000 --> 1955:16:51,000
"We're helping a king right now though."

17
1955:18:31,000 --> 2061:45:11,000
He poked a blue bottle filled with liquid.

18
2061:46:51,000 --> 2133:08:31,000
Laozi looked up from his potion.

19
2133:10:11,000 --> 2176:53:31,000
[g@"Don't touch anything.

20
2176:55:11,000 --> 2305:01:51,000
Just tell me why you're here."@g]

21
2305:03:31,000 --> 2409:36:51,000
"I need pills that will bring someone back to life," said Wukong.

22
2409:38:31,000 --> 2503:41:51,000
"Give me one thousand of them."

23
2503:43:31,000 --> 2734:55:11,000
Laozi stopped what he was doing and walked over to Wukong.

24
2734:56:51,000 --> 2852:53:31,000
"How dare you tell me to give you one thousand pills!" he said.

25
2852:55:11,000 --> 2920:10:11,000
"Get out of here right now!"

26
2920:11:51,000 --> 3027:43:31,000
[g@The monkey laughed. "I'm kidding.

27
3027:45:11,000 --> 3105:15:11,000
I don't really need one thousand pills.@g]

28
3105:16:51,000 --> 3173:30:11,000
Just give me one hundred, and then I'll leave."

29
3173:31:51,000 --> 3267:36:51,000
Laozi squeezed his hands into fists.

30
3267:38:31,000 --> 3321:30:11,000
[g@"I'm not giving you any pills.

31
3321:31:51,000 --> 3376:40:11,000
Now get out of here!"@g]

32
3376:41:51,000 --> 3476:46:51,000
Wukong scratched his head, pretending to think.

33
3476:48:31,000 --> 3601:30:11,000
"Now that I think about it, I don't need one hundred pills.

34
3601:31:51,000 --> 3682:58:31,000
Just give me ten."

35
3683:00:11,000 --> 3852:31:51,000
"You are rude and disrespectful!" yelled Laozi. "Get out!"

36
3852:33:31,000 --> 3948:55:11,000
[g@"I really just need one pill," said Wukong.

37
3948:56:51,000 --> 3983:45:11,000
"Give me that."@g]

38
3983:46:51,000 --> 4075:50:11,000
"Get out!" shouted Laozi.

39
4075:51:51,000 --> 4368:28:31,000
Wukong sighed and then left.

40
4368:30:11,000 --> 4482:40:11,000
[g@Laozi went back to his potion and stirred.

41
4482:41:51,000 --> 4538:45:11,000
But then he stopped.@g]

42
4538:46:51,000 --> 4677:15:11,000
"That monkey will definitely come back [n@and cause trouble," he said to himself.

43
4677:16:51,000 --> 4853:33:31,000
"I should just give him a pill."

44
4853:35:11,000 --> 5046:56:51,000
The sage opened a jar and took out a pill.

45
5046:58:31,000 --> 5252:28:31,000
He went outside and found Wukong waiting for him.

46
5252:30:11,000 --> 5319:03:31,000
"Hello again," said the monkey.

47
5319:05:11,000 --> 5442:48:31,000
"I was just trying to decide what sort of trouble I could cause for you."

48
5442:50:11,000 --> 5544:13:31,000
[g@Laozi frowned, shoving the pill toward Wukong.

49
5544:15:11,000 --> 5723:16:51,000
"Take this and leave."@g]

50
5723:18:31,000 --> 5820:10:11,000
Wukong returned to the monastery.

51
5820:11:51,000 --> 6011:51:51,000
Everyone watched as the monkey put the pill in the king's mouth.

52
6011:53:31,000 --> 6183:51:51,000
Light sparkled around the king, and then his eyes popped open.

53
6183:53:31,000 --> 6270:43:31,000
The king sat up and looked at Wukong.

54
6270:45:11,000 --> 6381:45:11,000
[g@"You . . . saved me," the king said.

55
6381:46:51,000 --> 6456:41:51,000
"I'm alive again!"@g]

56
6456:43:31,000 --> 6594:03:31,000
He turned and saw the prince standing nearby. "My son!"

57
6594:05:11,000 --> 6669:41:51,000
[g@"Father!" said the prince.

58
6669:43:31,000 --> 6760:21:51,000
He took his father's hands and bowed his head.@g]

59
6760:23:31,000 --> 6797:28:31,000
[g@"I've missed you.

60
6797:30:11,000 --> 6964:40:11,000
It's time for you to return to your palace."@g]

61
6964:41:51,000 --> 7074:40:11,000
The prince led everyone to the palace.

62
7074:41:51,000 --> 7180:28:31,000
They walked past guards and went into the throne room.

63
7180:30:11,000 --> 7285:18:31,000
The prince kneeled down before the Daoist.

64
7285:20:11,000 --> 7357:26:51,000
[g@"Greetings, son," said the Daoist.

65
7357:28:31,000 --> 7409:03:31,000
"Who are these people?"@g]

66
7409:05:11,000 --> 7471:05:11,000
[g@The prince stood up.

67
7471:06:51,000 --> 7530:41:51,000
"This is the Tang Monk.@g]

68
7530:43:31,000 --> 7649:31:51,000
He is going to the Western Paradise to get scriptures from Buddha.

69
7649:33:31,000 --> 7724:50:11,000
These three are his companions."

70
7724:51:51,000 --> 7820:08:31,000
The Daoist looked at a person standing near them.

71
7820:10:11,000 --> 7899:41:51,000
[g@The person was wearing a hood.

72
7899:43:31,000 --> 7983:06:51,000
"Who is that man wearing the hood?"@g]

73
7983:08:31,000 --> 8109:56:51,000
The man pulled the hood back and showed his face.

74
8109:58:31,000 --> 8194:20:11,000
The Daoist gasped. "The king!"

75
8194:21:51,000 --> 8335:20:11,000
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and leaped toward the Daoist.

76
8335:21:51,000 --> 8557:13:31,000
The Daoist snapped his fingers and vanished.
