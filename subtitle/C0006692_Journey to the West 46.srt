1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,466
The Tang Monk glared at Wukong.

2
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:19,035
"Bajie says you can bring the king back to life," said the monk.

3
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:22,974
"Please do so now."

4
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:27,968
Wukong shot a look at Bajie, who was trying not to laugh.

5
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:32,601
"Master, use the Tight Headband spell!" said the pig.

6
00:00:32,602 --> 00:00:36,815
"Don't!" cried Wukong. "I'll ask Laozi for help.

7
00:00:36,816 --> 00:00:39,673
He makes pills that can make people live forever.

8
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:46,325
Maybe he makes pills that can bring people back to life."

9
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:49,398
Laozi was busy working on a potion.

10
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,869
Steam rose from the bubbling cauldron.

11
00:00:53,870 --> 00:01:01,478
Suddenly Wukong burst into the room. "Hello, Laozi!"

12
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,370
Laozi groaned. "What are you doing here, Wukong?

13
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:10,448
You're supposed to be helping the Tang Monk reach the Western Paradise."

14
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:15,416
Wukong walked around the room, looking at all the bottles and equipment.

15
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:18,549
"I'm still helping the Tang Monk," he said.

16
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,390
"We're helping a king right now though."

17
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:25,223
He poked a blue bottle filled with liquid.

18
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:27,793
Laozi looked up from his potion.

19
00:01:27,794 --> 00:01:29,368
"Don't touch anything.

20
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,981
Just tell me why you're here."

21
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:37,746
"I need pills that will bring someone back to life," said Wukong.

22
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:41,133
"Give me one thousand of them."

23
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:49,457
Laozi stopped what he was doing and walked over to Wukong.

24
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:53,704
"How dare you tell me to give you one thousand pills!" he said.

25
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:56,126
"Get out of here right now!"

26
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:59,998
The monkey laughed. "I'm kidding.

27
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:02,789
I don't really need one thousand pills.

28
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,246
Just give me one hundred, and then I'll leave."

29
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:08,634
Laozi squeezed his hands into fists.

30
00:02:08,635 --> 00:02:10,574
"I'm not giving you any pills.

31
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:12,560
Now get out of here!"

32
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:16,164
Wukong scratched his head, pretending to think.

33
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:20,654
"Now that I think about it, I don't need one hundred pills.

34
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:23,587
Just give me ten."

35
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:29,691
"You are rude and disrespectful!" yelled Laozi. "Get out!"

36
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:33,161
"I really just need one pill," said Wukong.

37
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:34,415
"Give me that."

38
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,730
"Get out!" shouted Laozi.

39
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:48,265
Wukong sighed and then left.

40
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:52,376
Laozi went back to his potion and stirred.

41
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:54,395
But then he stopped.

42
00:02:54,396 --> 00:02:59,381
"That monkey will definitely come back and cause trouble," he said to himself.

43
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:05,728
"I should just give him a pill."

44
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:12,690
The sage opened a jar and took out a pill.

45
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:20,089
He went outside and found Wukong waiting for him.

46
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,486
"Hello again," said the monkey.

47
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:26,941
"I was just trying to decide what sort of trouble I could cause for you."

48
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:30,592
Laozi frowned, shoving the pill toward Wukong.

49
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:37,038
"Take this and leave."

50
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,526
Wukong returned to the monastery.

51
00:03:40,527 --> 00:03:47,427
Everyone watched as the monkey put the pill in the king's mouth.

52
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:53,619
Light sparkled around the king, and then his eyes popped open.

53
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,746
The king sat up and looked at Wukong.

54
00:03:56,747 --> 00:04:00,743
"You . . . saved me," the king said.

55
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:03,441
"I'm alive again!"

56
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:08,386
He turned and saw the prince standing nearby. "My son!"

57
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:11,109
"Father!" said the prince.

58
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,373
He took his father's hands and bowed his head.

59
00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:15,709
"I've missed you.

60
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:21,728
It's time for you to return to your palace."

61
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:25,688
The prince led everyone to the palace.

62
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:29,497
They walked past guards and went into the throne room.

63
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:33,271
The prince kneeled down before the Daoist.

64
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:35,868
"Greetings, son," said the Daoist.

65
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:37,726
"Who are these people?"

66
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:39,959
The prince stood up.

67
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,105
"This is the Tang Monk.

68
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:46,383
He is going to the Western Paradise to get scriptures from Buddha.

69
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:49,094
These three are his companions."

70
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:52,525
The Daoist looked at a person standing near them.

71
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,389
The person was wearing a hood.

72
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,392
"Who is that man wearing the hood?"

73
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:02,958
The man pulled the hood back and showed his face.

74
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,996
The Daoist gasped. "The king!"

75
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:11,072
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and leaped toward the Daoist.

76
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:19,060
The Daoist snapped his fingers and vanished.
