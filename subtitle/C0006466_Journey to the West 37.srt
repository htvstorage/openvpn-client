1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:17,441
"Who are you?" the monster asked the monkey.

2
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:20,181
"What are you doing here?"

3
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:25,873
"I am Sun Wukong, king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain," said the monkey.

4
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:29,415
"I'm helping the Tang Monk reach the Western Paradise.

5
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:33,484
Five hundred years ago, I caused a lot of trouble in Heaven.

6
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:37,112
Now I'm here to cause a lot of trouble for you!"

7
00:00:37,113 --> 00:00:40,791
"I remember you," said the monster.

8
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:45,267
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and swung it.

9
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:52,301
Poof! The monster vanished.

10
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,052
Wukong leaped into the air.

11
00:00:56,053 --> 00:01:00,660
He looked in every direction but didn't see the monster anywhere.

12
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:05,999
"That monster said he remembered me," thought Wukong.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,336
"He must be from Heaven.

14
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:13,407
I'll go up there now to see if any spirits are missing."

15
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:18,452
Wukong soared higher and higher until he reached the southern gate of Heaven.

16
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,606
"Greetings, Wukong," said the guard.

17
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:26,215
"There's a monster on Earth causing trouble for the Tang Monk," said Wukong.

18
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:29,945
"I think the monster is a spirit who escaped from Heaven.

19
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:31,733
Is anyone missing?"

20
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:35,829
The guard sent a messenger to check.

21
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,511
A moment later the messenger returned.

22
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:40,946
A god was with him.

23
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:46,517
"You found the Wood Wolf Star," said the god.

24
00:01:46,518 --> 00:01:48,936
"Who?" asked Wukong.

25
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:54,699
"The Wood Wolf Star is a wolf spirit who lives in Heaven," said the god.

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,990
"He escaped 13 days ago, and I've been looking all over for him."

27
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:03,366
Wukong rubbed his chin.

28
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,674
"That makes sense," he said.

29
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:09,470
"The monster kidnapped a princess 13 years ago on Earth.

30
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:13,237
Thirteen years on Earth is equal to 13 days in Heaven."

31
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:17,390
The god nodded. "Yes. Let's go.

32
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:22,356
I'll help you catch the Wood Wolf Star."

33
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:26,703
Wukong returned to Earth with the god.

34
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:31,460
From the sky the god called down, "Wood Wolf Star!

35
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:34,273
Come up here at once!"

36
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:39,328
Wukong saw a small splash in a river below.

37
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:42,192
The monster leaped out.

38
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:47,475
The monster turned into a wolf and flew up to the god.

39
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:49,977
The wolf looked nervous.

40
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:54,059
"You will be punished!" said the god.

41
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,613
He turned and led the wolf back up to Heaven.

42
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:04,497
Wukong flew to the Precious Image Kingdom and went into the palace.

43
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:07,685
A big celebration was taking place.

44
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:13,631
The king and queen were both hugging their daughter, Princess Hundred Flowers.

45
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:17,014
The princess saw Wukong and smiled.

46
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:20,912
"Father, Mother—this is Sun Wukong.

47
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:25,914
He's the monkey spirit who rescued Sha Wujing and me earlier."

48
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,980
The king and queen bowed.

49
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:31,228
"We can never thank you enough," said the queen.

50
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:35,881
"You and your friends have made us very happy."

51
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,818
"It was nothing at all," said Wukong with a laugh.

52
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:44,753
"We save people from monsters and demons almost every day."

53
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:46,915
He looked around.

54
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,105
"Where's the Tang Monk?"

55
00:03:49,106 --> 00:03:51,226
The king looked at the ground.

56
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:52,967
"Didn't your friends tell you?

57
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:55,709
He is really a tiger."

58
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,619
"Nonsense!" said Wukong.

59
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,387
"That monster turned him into a tiger, that's all.

60
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:03,288
Where is he?"

61
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:08,109
The king and queen led Wukong out of the hall.

62
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,412
They went down a flight of stairs and arrived at the palace dungeon.

63
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:17,420
A large tiger sat in a cage.

64
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:20,210
"Don't worry, Master," said Wukong.

65
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:22,979
"I'll change you back into yourself."

66
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,516
Wukong recited a spell.

67
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:30,336
Bright light surrounded the cage for a moment.

68
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,904
The Tang Monk was back!

69
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:37,833
Wukong grabbed the bars and twisted them apart.

70
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:40,644
"Thank you, Wukong," cried the monk.

71
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:43,339
He took the monkey's hands in his own.

72
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,942
"I never should have told you to leave.

73
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:48,561
Will you continue the journey with us?"

74
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:59,321
Wukong smiled. "We will reach the Western Paradise together."
