1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,662
Wukong glared at the two scared priests.

2
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:21,097
[g@"The robe is gone?" he cried.

3
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:23,028
"Where did it go?"@g]

4
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:25,986
"We don't know!" said one priest.

5
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:28,745
"We tried to find it," added the other.

6
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:31,692
"The robe was in a room that didn't get burned at all.

7
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:33,895
But it's not there anymore."

8
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:38,988
His iron bar instantly appeared from inside his ear.

9
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:42,319
[g@"Grow!" commanded Wukong.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,876
The monkey swung it toward the two priests.@g]

11
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:50,967
But before the bar hit them, it dropped from the monkey's hands.

12
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,599
[g@Wukong fell to the ground, crying in pain.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,132
"It hurts! It hurts!" he cried.@g]

14
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:02,153
The Tang Monk was quietly reciting the Tight Headband spell.

15
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:06,114
Wukong rolled around, kicking and screaming.

16
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:08,926
The two priests jumped up and backed away.

17
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:13,446
"Stop reciting the spell!" Wukong yelled at the Tang Monk.

18
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:14,832
[g@"I'm begging you!

19
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,181
I won't hurt the priests!"@g]

20
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:23,523
The Tang Monk stopped, and Wukong stood up.

21
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:29,514
The monkey took a deep breath and put the iron bar back in his ear.

22
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:32,621
The Tang Monk looked at the two priests.

23
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:35,600
"You really don't know where the robe is?"

24
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:38,283
"No," said one priest.

25
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:40,717
[g@"The head priest ran away last night.

26
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:42,840
He didn't have it with him."@g]

27
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:45,512
[g@Wukong tapped his chin.

28
00:01:45,513 --> 00:01:48,996
"A monster or demon might have stolen it.@g]

29
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:52,516
Are there any monsters or demons living near here?"

30
00:01:52,517 --> 00:01:57,213
"Some people believe there's a monster in the [n@mountains nearby," said the other priest.

31
00:01:57,214 --> 00:02:00,316
"They say it's a black bear spirit."

32
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:03,792
[g@"I'll go see if the bear took the robe," said Wukong.

33
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:06,268
"I'll be back soon."@g]

34
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:14,583
Wukong leaped into the air and landed up in the mountains.

35
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:18,747
He walked for a bit and then heard voices.

36
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:23,344
Peeking over a boulder, he saw a group of spirits talking.

37
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:28,331
One was a large black bear.

38
00:02:28,332 --> 00:02:33,102
The bear laughed. "The monastery was on fire last night.

39
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:37,870
I went down to check it out and found a wonderful Buddhist robe.

40
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:41,290
[g@I think it's a Buddhist treasure.

41
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,185
Anyway, I stole it.@g]

42
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:49,779
So tonight I'm throwing a feast to celebrate!"

43
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,158
When Wukong heard the other spirits laugh, he was furious.

44
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,742
He jumped over the boulder and landed in the middle of the group.

45
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:02,202
"Give back the robe right now!" he cried.

46
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:04,738
[g@He pulled out his iron bar.

47
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,984
"Or I'll destroy all of you!"@g]

48
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:12,595
The spirits all fled in different directions.

49
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:17,445
Wukong chased the bear until they reached a cave entrance.

50
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:24,723
The bear ran inside and slammed the door shut.

51
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:27,931
Wukong pounded on the cave's door.

52
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:31,880
"Come out here right now or I'll smash this door down!"

53
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:34,121
[g@The door flew open.

54
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:35,814
The bear stepped out.

55
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,474
He was holding a lance.@g]

56
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:43,811
"How dare you pound on my door and yell at me!" he cried.

57
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:47,330
"You stole my master's robe!" said Wukong.

58
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:50,842
[g@"I can do whatever I want," said the bear.

59
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:53,928
"I am the Black Wind King.@g]

60
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:58,417
I'm the most powerful monster in these mountains!"

61
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:03,798
"I am Sun Wukong, king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain," said the monkey.

62
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,668
"I caused lots of trouble in Heaven five hundred years ago.

63
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:12,195
The Jade Emperor's entire army couldn't defeat me!"

64
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:14,666
[g@The Black Wind King snorted.

65
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,352
"You don't impress me."@g]

66
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:20,682
He jabbed his lance at Wukong.

67
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:25,384
[i@Clang!@i] The monkey blocked the lance with his iron bar.

68
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:31,080
Rocks tumbled and rolled downhill as the two warriors fought.

69
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:36,118
After an hour of fighting, the Black Wind King held up a hand.

70
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,708
[g@"I need to take a break.

71
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:41,304
It's time for my lunch."@g]

72
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:45,341
Wukong's jaw fell open. "What?"

73
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:51,255
Before Wukong could say anything else, the bear ran back into his cave.

74
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:58,162
The door slammed shut.
