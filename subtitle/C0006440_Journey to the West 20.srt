1
00:00:11,000 --> 185:03:31,000
Wukong glared at the two scared priests.

2
185:05:11,000 --> 280:28:31,000
[g@"The robe is gone?" he cried.

3
280:30:11,000 --> 334:06:51,000
"Where did it go?"@g]

4
334:08:31,000 --> 416:16:51,000
"We don't know!" said one priest.

5
416:18:31,000 --> 492:55:11,000
"We tried to find it," added the other.

6
492:56:51,000 --> 574:46:51,000
"The robe was in a room that didn't get burned at all.

7
574:48:31,000 --> 635:58:31,000
But it's not there anymore."

8
636:00:11,000 --> 777:26:51,000
His iron bar instantly appeared from inside his ear.

9
777:28:31,000 --> 869:58:31,000
[g@"Grow!" commanded Wukong.

10
870:00:11,000 --> 968:46:51,000
The monkey swung it toward the two priests.@g]

11
968:48:31,000 --> 1110:11:51,000
But before the bar hit them, it dropped from the monkey's hands.

12
1110:13:31,000 --> 1211:05:11,000
[g@Wukong fell to the ground, crying in pain.

13
1211:06:51,000 --> 1309:13:31,000
"It hurts! It hurts!" he cried.@g]

14
1309:15:11,000 --> 1420:55:11,000
The Tang Monk was quietly reciting the Tight Headband spell.

15
1420:56:51,000 --> 1530:56:51,000
Wukong rolled around, kicking and screaming.

16
1530:58:31,000 --> 1609:03:31,000
The two priests jumped up and backed away.

17
1609:05:11,000 --> 1734:36:51,000
"Stop reciting the spell!" Wukong yelled at the Tang Monk.

18
1734:38:31,000 --> 1773:06:51,000
[g@"I'm begging you!

19
1773:08:31,000 --> 1838:21:51,000
I won't hurt the priests!"@g]

20
1838:23:31,000 --> 2014:31:51,000
The Tang Monk stopped, and Wukong stood up.

21
2014:33:31,000 --> 2180:56:51,000
The monkey took a deep breath and put the iron bar back in his ear.

22
2180:58:31,000 --> 2267:15:11,000
The Tang Monk looked at the two priests.

23
2267:16:51,000 --> 2350:00:11,000
"You really don't know where the robe is?"

24
2350:01:51,000 --> 2424:31:51,000
"No," said one priest.

25
2424:33:31,000 --> 2492:08:31,000
[g@"The head priest ran away last night.

26
2492:10:11,000 --> 2551:06:51,000
He didn't have it with him."@g]

27
2551:08:31,000 --> 2625:20:11,000
[g@Wukong tapped his chin.

28
2625:21:51,000 --> 2722:06:51,000
"A monster or demon might have stolen it.@g]

29
2722:08:31,000 --> 2819:53:31,000
Are there any monsters or demons living near here?"

30
2819:55:11,000 --> 2950:21:51,000
"Some people believe there's a monster in the [n@mountains nearby," said the other priest.

31
2950:23:31,000 --> 3036:33:31,000
"They say it's a black bear spirit."

32
3036:35:11,000 --> 3133:06:51,000
[g@"I'll go see if the bear took the robe," said Wukong.

33
3133:08:31,000 --> 3201:53:31,000
"I'll be back soon."@g]

34
3201:55:11,000 --> 3432:51:51,000
Wukong leaped into the air and landed up in the mountains.

35
3432:53:31,000 --> 3548:31:51,000
He walked for a bit and then heard voices.

36
3548:33:31,000 --> 3676:13:31,000
Peeking over a boulder, he saw a group of spirits talking.

37
3676:15:11,000 --> 3814:45:11,000
One was a large black bear.

38
3814:46:51,000 --> 3947:16:51,000
The bear laughed. "The monastery was on fire last night.

39
3947:18:31,000 --> 4079:43:31,000
I went down to check it out and found a wonderful Buddhist robe.

40
4079:45:11,000 --> 4174:43:31,000
[g@I think it's a Buddhist treasure.

41
4174:45:11,000 --> 4255:08:31,000
Anyway, I stole it.@g]

42
4255:10:11,000 --> 4410:31:51,000
So tonight I'm throwing a feast to celebrate!"

43
4410:33:31,000 --> 4532:10:11,000
When Wukong heard the other spirits laugh, he was furious.

44
4532:11:51,000 --> 4659:30:11,000
He jumped over the boulder and landed in the middle of the group.

45
4659:31:51,000 --> 4755:36:51,000
"Give back the robe right now!" he cried.

46
4755:38:31,000 --> 4826:03:31,000
[g@He pulled out his iron bar.

47
4826:05:11,000 --> 4916:13:31,000
"Or I'll destroy all of you!"@g]

48
4916:15:11,000 --> 5044:18:31,000
The spirits all fled in different directions.

49
5044:20:11,000 --> 5179:01:51,000
Wukong chased the bear until they reached a cave entrance.

50
5179:03:31,000 --> 5381:11:51,000
The bear ran inside and slammed the door shut.

51
5381:13:31,000 --> 5470:18:31,000
Wukong pounded on the cave's door.

52
5470:20:11,000 --> 5580:00:11,000
"Come out here right now or I'll smash this door down!"

53
5580:01:51,000 --> 5642:15:11,000
[g@The door flew open.

54
5642:16:51,000 --> 5689:16:51,000
The bear stepped out.

55
5689:18:31,000 --> 5763:10:11,000
He was holding a lance.@g]

56
5763:11:51,000 --> 5911:25:11,000
"How dare you pound on my door and yell at me!" he cried.

57
5911:26:51,000 --> 6009:10:11,000
"You stole my master's robe!" said Wukong.

58
6009:11:51,000 --> 6106:43:31,000
[g@"I can do whatever I want," said the bear.

59
6106:45:11,000 --> 6192:26:51,000
"I am the Black Wind King.@g]

60
6192:28:31,000 --> 6317:08:31,000
I'm the most powerful monster in these mountains!"

61
6317:10:11,000 --> 6466:36:51,000
"I am Sun Wukong, king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain," said the monkey.

62
6466:38:31,000 --> 6574:06:51,000
"I caused lots of trouble in Heaven five hundred years ago.

63
6574:08:31,000 --> 6699:51:51,000
The Jade Emperor's entire army couldn't defeat me!"

64
6699:53:31,000 --> 6768:30:11,000
[g@The Black Wind King snorted.

65
6768:31:51,000 --> 6843:06:51,000
"You don't impress me."@g]

66
6843:08:31,000 --> 6935:36:51,000
He jabbed his lance at Wukong.

67
6935:38:31,000 --> 7066:13:31,000
[i@Clang!@i] The monkey blocked the lance with his iron bar.

68
7066:15:11,000 --> 7224:26:51,000
Rocks tumbled and rolled downhill as the two warriors fought.

69
7224:28:31,000 --> 7364:23:31,000
After an hour of fighting, the Black Wind King held up a hand.

70
7364:25:11,000 --> 7436:20:11,000
[g@"I need to take a break.

71
7436:21:51,000 --> 7508:26:51,000
It's time for my lunch."@g]

72
7508:28:31,000 --> 7620:35:11,000
Wukong's jaw fell open. "What?"

73
7620:36:51,000 --> 7784:51:51,000
Before Wukong could say anything else, the bear ran back into his cave.

74
7784:53:31,000 --> 7976:43:31,000
The door slammed shut.
