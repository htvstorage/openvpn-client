00:00:11,000 --> 147:55:11,000
[g@"I wish I had money," Bajie moaned.

2
147:56:51,000 --> 229:55:11,000
"All this food looks so good."@g]

3
229:56:51,000 --> 352:56:51,000
The travelers were walking through a city in the Scarlet Kingdom.

4
352:58:31,000 --> 470:35:11,000
The streets were lined with people selling food and other goods.

5
470:36:51,000 --> 617:45:11,000
"Stop thinking about food, Bajie," said Wujing.

6
617:46:51,000 --> 708:41:51,000
"What's going on over there?" asked the Tang Monk.

7
708:43:31,000 --> 825:41:51,000
He pointed to a crowd of people reading a sign on a wall.

8
825:43:31,000 --> 938:23:31,000
The travelers walked over to the crowd.

9
938:25:11,000 --> 1077:01:51,000
The sign read: "The King of the Scarlet Kingdom is seeking help.

10
1077:03:31,000 --> 1270:41:51,000
Anyone who can defeat demons must report to the royal palace."

11
1270:43:31,000 --> 1330:23:31,000
[g@The Tang Monk sighed.

12
1330:25:11,000 --> 1387:43:31,000
"I don't want to delay our journey.@g]

13
1387:45:11,000 --> 1457:06:51,000
[g@But you three can defeat demons.

14
1457:08:31,000 --> 1527:53:31,000
We must report to the palace."@g]

15
1527:55:11,000 --> 1616:15:11,000
"Don't worry, Master," said Wukong.

16
1616:16:51,000 --> 1670:50:11,000
[g@"I'm great at defeating demons.

17
1670:51:51,000 --> 1728:05:11,000
This won't take long."@g]

18
1728:06:51,000 --> 1928:30:11,000
"I hope they have food at the palace," said Bajie. "I'm starving."

19
1928:31:51,000 --> 2005:53:31,000
The travelers arrived at the palace gate.

20
2005:55:11,000 --> 2141:13:31,000
They spoke with a guard, who then led them into the court.

21
2141:15:11,000 --> 2250:11:51,000
The king sat on his throne, looking very sad.

22
2250:13:31,000 --> 2319:25:11,000
[g@"Your Majesty," said the guard.

23
2319:26:51,000 --> 2388:18:31,000
"The Tang Monk is here to see you.@g]

24
2388:20:11,000 --> 2492:55:11,000
He says his companions can defeat demons."

25
2492:56:51,000 --> 2584:10:11,000
The king looked up but didn't say anything.

26
2584:11:51,000 --> 2658:58:31,000
The guard whispered to the travelers.

27
2659:00:11,000 --> 2734:50:11,000
[g@"His Majesty is very upset.

28
2734:51:51,000 --> 2837:01:51,000
If you can help him, please do."@g]

29
2837:03:31,000 --> 2986:28:31,000
Wukong walked up to the king.

30
2986:30:11,000 --> 3046:06:51,000
"Greetings, Your Majesty.

31
3046:08:31,000 --> 3253:23:31,000
I am Sun Wukong, king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

32
3253:25:11,000 --> 3327:21:51,000
[g@You need someone who can defeat demons.

33
3327:23:31,000 --> 3430:23:31,000
Well, here I am!"@g]

34
3430:25:11,000 --> 3582:36:51,000
Suddenly the king covered his face with his hands and burst out crying.

35
3582:38:31,000 --> 3668:41:51,000
[g@"Oh, it's terrible!" cried the king.

36
3668:43:31,000 --> 3739:35:11,000
"I have no hope anymore!"@g]

37
3739:36:51,000 --> 3838:51:51,000
Wukong scratched his head. "What's wrong?"

38
3838:53:31,000 --> 3938:58:31,000
[g@"The queen—my wife!" cried the king.

39
3939:00:11,000 --> 4080:45:11,000
"I'll never . . . Oh! It's terrible!"@g]

40
4080:46:51,000 --> 4227:05:11,000
Wukong frowned. "Your Majesty, stop crying!"

41
4227:06:51,000 --> 4359:25:11,000
"Wukong!" hissed the Tang Monk. "Show some respect."

42
4359:26:51,000 --> 4456:08:31,000
[g@Wukong ignored the monk and looked at the king.

43
4456:10:11,000 --> 4507:55:11,000
"I realize you're upset.@g]

44
4507:56:51,000 --> 4688:05:11,000
But if you want my help, you must stay calm and explain everything to me."

45
4688:06:51,000 --> 4803:11:51,000
The king sniffed and sat up straight. "You're right."

46
4803:13:31,000 --> 4938:01:51,000
He pulled out a handkerchief and blew his nose.

47
4938:03:31,000 --> 5036:36:51,000
"I will tell you what happened.

48
5036:38:31,000 --> 5162:56:51,000
Three years ago the Demon of Power attacked our kingdom.

49
5162:58:31,000 --> 5239:58:31,000
The demon kidnapped the queen.

50
5240:00:11,000 --> 5379:51:51,000
I sent soldiers to fight the demon and bring back my wife.

51
5379:53:31,000 --> 5473:30:11,000
But the demon was too powerful."

52
5473:31:51,000 --> 5588:40:11,000
"Where is the demon?" asked Wukong.

53
5588:41:51,000 --> 5777:51:51,000
The king got up and walked to a window.

54
5777:53:31,000 --> 5859:08:31,000
He pointed to a mountain in the distance.

55
5859:10:11,000 --> 5965:28:31,000
"The demon lives on that mountain."

56
5965:30:11,000 --> 6055:46:51,000
Wukong clapped the king on the back.

57
6055:48:31,000 --> 6122:36:51,000
[g@"You can stop being sad now, Your Majesty.

58
6122:38:31,000 --> 6190:20:11,000
I will rescue the queen.@g]

59
6190:21:51,000 --> 6303:06:51,000
In the meantime, please take care of my companions.

60
6303:08:31,000 --> 6456:35:11,000
I think Bajie is hungry."

61
6456:36:51,000 --> 6578:26:51,000
Wukong landed on the demon's mountain.

62
6578:28:31,000 --> 6717:00:11,000
Several small demons were standing outside a cave entrance.

63
6717:01:51,000 --> 6935:18:31,000
"Return the queen or I'll destroy all of you!" shouted the monkey.

64
6935:20:11,000 --> 7117:45:11,000
"Ahh!" cried the small demons as they ran into the cave.

65
7117:46:51,000 --> 7214:16:51,000
[g@Wukong heard another voice inside the cave.

66
7214:18:31,000 --> 7297:20:11,000
"What's going on?" it said.@g]

67
7297:21:51,000 --> 7441:43:31,000
"Master!" cried one demon. "There's a monkey outside.

68
7441:45:11,000 --> 7617:55:11,000
We must return the queen, or he'll destroy all of us!"

69
7617:56:51,000 --> 7752:03:31,000
A large demon with broad shoulders came out of the cave.

70
7752:05:11,000 --> 7814:20:11,000
He wore three bells.

71
7814:21:51,000 --> 7920:58:31,000
[g@"I am the Demon of Power!" shouted the demon.

72
7921:00:11,000 --> 8024:03:31,000
"Get off of my mountain!"@g]

73
8024:05:11,000 --> 8082:25:11,000
[g@Wukong was furious.

74
8082:26:51,000 --> 8172:46:51,000
"Do you know who I am? I'm the—"@g]

75
8172:48:31,000 --> 8389:58:31,000
[i@Whoosh!@i] Flames shot all over, smoke filled the air, [n@and sand whipped past Wukong.

76
8390:00:11,000 --> 8566:16:51,000
The monkey coughed as sand flew up his nose.

77
8566:18:31,000 --> 8659:11:51,000
"This is awful!" cried Wukong.

78
8659:13:31,000 --> 8881:28:31,000
He covered his face and leaped off the mountain.
