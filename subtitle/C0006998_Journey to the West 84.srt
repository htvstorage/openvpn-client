00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,325
[g@"I wish I had money," Bajie moaned.

2
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:19,277
"All this food looks so good."@g]

3
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,706
The travelers were walking through a city in the Scarlet Kingdom.

4
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:27,941
The streets were lined with people selling food and other goods.

5
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:33,239
"Stop thinking about food, Bajie," said Wujing.

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,513
"What's going on over there?" asked the Tang Monk.

7
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:40,725
He pointed to a crowd of people reading a sign on a wall.

8
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:44,782
The travelers walked over to the crowd.

9
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:49,773
The sign read: "The King of the Scarlet Kingdom is seeking help.

10
00:00:49,774 --> 00:00:56,745
Anyone who can defeat demons must report to the royal palace."

11
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:58,894
[g@The Tang Monk sighed.

12
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:00,958
"I don't want to delay our journey.@g]

13
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:03,456
[g@But you three can defeat demons.

14
00:01:03,457 --> 00:01:06,004
We must report to the palace."@g]

15
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:09,185
"Don't worry, Master," said Wukong.

16
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:11,150
[g@"I'm great at defeating demons.

17
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:13,211
This won't take long."@g]

18
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:20,426
"I hope they have food at the palace," said Bajie. "I'm starving."

19
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:23,212
The travelers arrived at the palace gate.

20
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:28,084
They spoke with a guard, who then led them into the court.

21
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:32,007
The king sat on his throne, looking very sad.

22
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,499
[g@"Your Majesty," said the guard.

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,979
"The Tang Monk is here to see you.@g]

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,745
He says his companions can defeat demons."

25
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:44,030
The king looked up but didn't say anything.

26
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:46,723
The guard whispered to the travelers.

27
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:49,454
[g@"His Majesty is very upset.

28
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:53,133
If you can help him, please do."@g]

29
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:58,513
Wukong walked up to the king.

30
00:01:58,514 --> 00:02:00,660
"Greetings, Your Majesty.

31
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:08,122
I am Sun Wukong, king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

32
00:02:08,123 --> 00:02:10,785
[g@You need someone who can defeat demons.

33
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:14,494
Well, here I am!"@g]

34
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:19,974
Suddenly the king covered his face with his hands and burst out crying.

35
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:23,073
[g@"Oh, it's terrible!" cried the king.

36
00:02:23,074 --> 00:02:25,625
"I have no hope anymore!"@g]

37
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:29,199
Wukong scratched his head. "What's wrong?"

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,803
[g@"The queen—my wife!" cried the king.

39
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:37,907
"I'll never . . . Oh! It's terrible!"@g]

40
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:43,175
Wukong frowned. "Your Majesty, stop crying!"

41
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:47,939
"Wukong!" hissed the Tang Monk. "Show some respect."

42
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,421
[g@Wukong ignored the monk and looked at the king.

43
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,285
"I realize you're upset.@g]

44
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:59,771
But if you want my help, you must stay calm and explain everything to me."

45
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:03,915
The king sniffed and sat up straight. "You're right."

46
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:08,769
He pulled out a handkerchief and blew his nose.

47
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,318
"I will tell you what happened.

48
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,866
Three years ago the Demon of Power attacked our kingdom.

49
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,639
The demon kidnapped the queen.

50
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,675
I sent soldiers to fight the demon and bring back my wife.

51
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:28,046
But the demon was too powerful."

52
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:32,192
"Where is the demon?" asked Wukong.

53
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:39,003
The king got up and walked to a window.

54
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:41,929
He pointed to a mountain in the distance.

55
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,757
"The demon lives on that mountain."

56
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,008
Wukong clapped the king on the back.

57
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:51,414
[g@"You can stop being sad now, Your Majesty.

58
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:53,852
I will rescue the queen.@g]

59
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:57,912
In the meantime, please take care of my companions.

60
00:03:57,913 --> 00:04:03,437
I think Bajie is hungry."

61
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,824
Wukong landed on the demon's mountain.

62
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:12,812
Several small demons were standing outside a cave entrance.

63
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:20,671
"Return the queen or I'll destroy all of you!" shouted the monkey.

64
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:27,239
"Ahh!" cried the small demons as they ran into the cave.

65
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,714
[g@Wukong heard another voice inside the cave.

66
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:33,704
"What's going on?" it said.@g]

67
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:38,902
"Master!" cried one demon. "There's a monkey outside.

68
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:45,245
We must return the queen, or he'll destroy all of us!"

69
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:50,074
A large demon with broad shoulders came out of the cave.

70
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:52,316
He wore three bells.

71
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:56,155
[g@"I am the Demon of Power!" shouted the demon.

72
00:04:56,156 --> 00:04:59,866
"Get off of my mountain!"@g]

73
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,967
[g@Wukong was furious.

74
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,220
"Do you know who I am? I'm the—"@g]

75
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:13,039
[i@Whoosh!@i] Flames shot all over, smoke filled the air, [n@and sand whipped past Wukong.

76
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,386
The monkey coughed as sand flew up his nose.

77
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:22,731
"This is awful!" cried Wukong.

78
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:30,733
He covered his face and leaped off the mountain.
