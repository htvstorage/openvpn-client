1
00:00:11,000 --> 118:08:31,000
The demon eyed the smiling boy suspiciously.

2
118:10:11,000 --> 220:46:51,000
"Aren't you scared of me?" asked the demon.

3
220:48:31,000 --> 371:36:51,000
"No," said the boy. "Should I be?"

4
371:38:31,000 --> 511:58:31,000
"Well, yes," said the demon. "I plan to eat you.

5
512:00:11,000 --> 605:56:51,000
Doesn't that sound terrible?"

6
605:58:31,000 --> 690:51:51,000
The boy shrugged. "Not really."

7
690:53:31,000 --> 799:43:31,000
The demon hesitated for a moment and then moved closer.

8
799:45:11,000 --> 907:46:51,000
Suddenly the boy changed into Wukong.

9
907:48:31,000 --> 1014:18:31,000
The monkey pulled out his iron bar and swung.

10
1014:20:11,000 --> 1121:35:11,000
The demon jumped back, and Wukong missed.

11
1121:36:51,000 --> 1226:23:31,000
"Who are you?" demanded the demon.

12
1226:25:11,000 --> 1314:45:11,000
"I am Sun Wukong," said the monkey.

13
1314:46:51,000 --> 1382:56:51,000
"And you should be ashamed of yourself!

14
1382:58:31,000 --> 1467:10:11,000
What kind of monster eats children?"

15
1467:11:51,000 --> 1548:46:51,000
"Sun Wukong?" said the demon.

16
1548:48:31,000 --> 1625:03:31,000
[g@"I thought you were trapped under a mountain.

17
1625:05:11,000 --> 1702:58:31,000
What are you doing here?"@g]

18
1703:00:11,000 --> 1785:41:51,000
"My punishment is over," said the monkey.

19
1785:43:31,000 --> 1893:05:11,000
"I am traveling to the Western Paradise with the Tang Monk."

20
1893:06:51,000 --> 1941:25:11,000
[g@The demon's eyes lit up.

21
1941:26:51,000 --> 2022:53:31,000
"The Tang Monk!"@g]

22
2022:55:11,000 --> 2119:53:31,000
[g@Wukong lunged.

23
2119:55:11,000 --> 2292:53:31,000
The demon spun around and disappeared.@g]

24
2292:55:11,000 --> 2449:51:51,000
The monkey returned to Chen's home and told everyone what had happened.

25
2449:53:31,000 --> 2611:11:51,000
"Because of you, I still have my son," said Chen. "Thank you."

26
2611:13:31,000 --> 2690:11:51,000
"You're welcome," said Wukong.

27
2690:13:31,000 --> 2801:33:31,000
"But I believe the demon now wants to capture the Tang Monk.

28
2801:35:11,000 --> 2937:10:11,000
So in the morning we must find a boat and leave."

29
2937:11:51,000 --> 3034:08:31,000
Meanwhile the demon was deep under the water.

30
3034:10:11,000 --> 3172:33:31,000
"I must capture the Tang Monk and eat him," he said to himself.

31
3172:35:11,000 --> 3259:15:11,000
[g@"It won't be easy with that monkey around.

32
3259:16:51,000 --> 3358:53:31,000
I'll need some magic."@g]

33
3358:55:11,000 --> 3476:31:51,000
[g@Late that night a cold wind blew.

34
3476:33:31,000 --> 3581:43:31,000
A snowflake drifted to the ground.@g]

35
3581:45:11,000 --> 3702:36:51,000
Then another one fell, and another.

36
3702:38:31,000 --> 3757:11:51,000
[g@Bajie couldn't sleep.

37
3757:13:31,000 --> 3874:55:11,000
"It's freezing in here," he said to himself.@g]

38
3874:56:51,000 --> 3952:41:51,000
[g@He looked at Wukong and Wujing.

39
3952:43:31,000 --> 4045:38:31,000
Both of them were sleeping soundly.@g]

40
4045:40:11,000 --> 4137:15:11,000
"Those two look very comfortable," said the pig.

41
4137:16:51,000 --> 4260:18:31,000
"Their blankets must be warmer than mine."

42
4260:20:11,000 --> 4374:48:31,000
In the morning Wukong woke up, shivering.

43
4374:50:11,000 --> 4521:51:51,000
"Th-that was a t-terrible night's sleep," he said to himself.

44
4521:53:31,000 --> 4579:26:51,000
[g@"I was so cold!"

45
4579:28:31,000 --> 4648:18:31,000
He looked down at his body.@g]

46
4648:20:11,000 --> 4701:36:51,000
[g@"No wonder I was cold!

47
4701:38:31,000 --> 4757:03:31,000
What happened to my blanket?"@g]

48
4757:05:11,000 --> 4803:53:31,000
Wujing woke up.

49
4803:55:11,000 --> 4917:35:11,000
[g@"Why is it so cold in—ah-choo!—in here?

50
4917:36:51,000 --> 5039:16:51,000
Where did my blanket go?"@g]

51
5039:18:31,000 --> 5101:53:31,000
[g@They looked at Bajie.

52
5101:55:11,000 --> 5208:56:51,000
The pig was tucked cozily under three blankets.@g]

53
5208:58:31,000 --> 5325:16:51,000
Even his head was covered.

54
5325:18:31,000 --> 5381:11:51,000
[g@Wukong gave him a kick.

55
5381:13:31,000 --> 5468:51:51,000
"Wake up, thief!"@g]

56
5468:53:31,000 --> 5566:03:31,000
Bajie rolled over, giggling under the blankets.

57
5566:05:11,000 --> 5708:25:11,000
Wujing frowned. "You stole our—ah-choo!"

58
5708:26:51,000 --> 5776:15:11,000
[g@Wukong scratched his head.

59
5776:16:51,000 --> 5924:41:51,000
"Why is it so cold anyway? It's spring."@g]

60
5924:43:31,000 --> 5998:30:11,000
[g@He looked out the window and gasped.

61
5998:31:51,000 --> 6079:41:51,000
"It snowed last night!"@g]

62
6079:43:31,000 --> 6189:50:11,000
They woke the Tang Monk and Chen, and everyone went outside.

63
6189:51:51,000 --> 6313:05:11,000
A thick blanket of snow covered the entire village.

64
6313:06:51,000 --> 6428:25:11,000
"It would be dangerous to cross the river in this weather," said Chen.

65
6428:26:51,000 --> 6530:10:11,000
"You should stay here until the snow melts."

66
6530:11:51,000 --> 6583:31:51,000
[g@A villager ran over.

67
6583:33:31,000 --> 6678:51:51,000
"The river is frozen solid!" he said.@g]

68
6678:53:31,000 --> 6720:38:31,000
[g@"That's wonderful news!"

69
6720:40:11,000 --> 6768:31:51,000
The Tang Monk smiled.@g]

70
6768:33:31,000 --> 6879:33:31,000
"Maybe we can walk across it."

71
6879:35:11,000 --> 7005:41:51,000
The travelers thanked Chen and said good-bye.

72
7005:43:31,000 --> 7110:43:31,000
Soon they were standing at the edge of the frozen river.

73
7110:45:11,000 --> 7216:11:51,000
"I wonder if it's safe to walk on," said Wujing.

74
7216:13:31,000 --> 7313:08:31,000
"I'll test it with my rake," said Bajie.

75
7313:10:11,000 --> 7453:40:11,000
The pig walked onto the ice and raised his rake.

76
7453:41:51,000 --> 7614:30:11,000
[i@Slam!@i] He brought the rake down hard, but the ice didn't crack.

77
7614:31:51,000 --> 7679:40:11,000
"It's solid," he said.

78
7679:41:51,000 --> 7829:21:51,000
The travelers stepped onto the ice and started walking.

79
7829:23:31,000 --> 7958:25:11,000
After a few hours, the riverbank was no longer in sight.

80
7958:26:51,000 --> 8089:16:51,000
Suddenly there was a rumbling sound, and the ice shook.

81
8089:18:31,000 --> 8168:41:51,000
"What caused that?" asked the monk.

82
8168:43:31,000 --> 8277:31:51,000
"I don't know," said Wukong, "But we should be—"

83
8277:33:31,000 --> 8523:41:51,000
[i@Crack!@i] Underneath them, the ice split wide open!
