1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,253
The demon eyed the smiling boy suspiciously.

2
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:18,948
"Aren't you scared of me?" asked the demon.

3
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:24,378
"No," said the boy. "Should I be?"

4
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:29,431
"Well, yes," said the demon. "I plan to eat you.

5
00:00:29,432 --> 00:00:32,814
Doesn't that sound terrible?"

6
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:35,871
The boy shrugged. "Not really."

7
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:39,790
The demon hesitated for a moment and then moved closer.

8
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,680
Suddenly the boy changed into Wukong.

9
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:47,515
The monkey pulled out his iron bar and swung.

10
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:51,377
The demon jumped back, and Wukong missed.

11
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:55,150
"Who are you?" demanded the demon.

12
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:58,331
"I am Sun Wukong," said the monkey.

13
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:00,786
"And you should be ashamed of yourself!

14
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:03,818
What kind of monster eats children?"

15
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:06,756
"Sun Wukong?" said the demon.

16
00:01:06,757 --> 00:01:09,502
[g@"I thought you were trapped under a mountain.

17
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,307
What are you doing here?"@g]

18
00:01:12,308 --> 00:01:15,285
"My punishment is over," said the monkey.

19
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:19,151
"I am traveling to the Western Paradise with the Tang Monk."

20
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:20,891
[g@The demon's eyes lit up.

21
00:01:20,892 --> 00:01:23,824
"The Tang Monk!"@g]

22
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:27,316
[g@Wukong lunged.

23
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:33,544
The demon spun around and disappeared.@g]

24
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:39,195
The monkey returned to Chen's home and told everyone what had happened.

25
00:01:39,196 --> 00:01:45,003
"Because of you, I still have my son," said Chen. "Thank you."

26
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,847
"You're welcome," said Wukong.

27
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:51,856
"But I believe the demon now wants to capture the Tang Monk.

28
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:56,738
So in the morning we must find a boat and leave."

29
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:00,229
Meanwhile the demon was deep under the water.

30
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,212
"I must capture the Tang Monk and eat him," he said to himself.

31
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:08,333
[g@"It won't be easy with that monkey around.

32
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:11,920
I'll need some magic."@g]

33
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:16,155
[g@Late that night a cold wind blew.

34
00:02:16,156 --> 00:02:19,942
A snowflake drifted to the ground.@g]

35
00:02:19,943 --> 00:02:24,294
Then another one fell, and another.

36
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:26,259
[g@Bajie couldn't sleep.

37
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,497
"It's freezing in here," he said to himself.@g]

38
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:33,297
[g@He looked at Wukong and Wujing.

39
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:36,643
Both of them were sleeping soundly.@g]

40
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:39,941
"Those two look very comfortable," said the pig.

41
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:44,371
"Their blankets must be warmer than mine."

42
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:48,493
In the morning Wukong woke up, shivering.

43
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:53,787
"Th-that was a t-terrible night's sleep," he said to himself.

44
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:55,860
[g@"I was so cold!"

45
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:58,339
He looked down at his body.@g]

46
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,258
[g@"No wonder I was cold!

47
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,254
What happened to my blanket?"@g]

48
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:03,940
Wujing woke up.

49
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:08,033
[g@"Why is it so cold in—ah-choo!—in here?

50
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:12,414
Where did my blanket go?"@g]

51
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,668
[g@They looked at Bajie.

52
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:18,522
The pig was tucked cozily under three blankets.@g]

53
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:22,710
Even his head was covered.

54
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:24,723
[g@Wukong gave him a kick.

55
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:27,879
"Wake up, thief!"@g]

56
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,378
Bajie rolled over, giggling under the blankets.

57
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:36,503
Wujing frowned. "You stole our—ah-choo!"

58
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:38,945
[g@Wukong scratched his head.

59
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:44,289
"Why is it so cold anyway? It's spring."@g]

60
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,946
[g@He looked out the window and gasped.

61
00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:49,869
"It snowed last night!"@g]

62
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,834
They woke the Tang Monk and Chen, and everyone went outside.

63
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:58,271
A thick blanket of snow covered the entire village.

64
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:02,423
"It would be dangerous to cross the river in this weather," said Chen.

65
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:06,086
"You should stay here until the snow melts."

66
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:08,007
[g@A villager ran over.

67
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:11,439
"The river is frozen solid!" he said.@g]

68
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,943
[g@"That's wonderful news!"

69
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:14,667
The Tang Monk smiled.@g]

70
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:18,664
"Maybe we can walk across it."

71
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:23,205
The travelers thanked Chen and said good-bye.

72
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:26,986
Soon they were standing at the edge of the frozen river.

73
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:30,783
"I wonder if it's safe to walk on," said Wujing.

74
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:34,273
"I'll test it with my rake," said Bajie.

75
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:39,332
The pig walked onto the ice and raised his rake.

76
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:45,122
[i@Slam!@i] He brought the rake down hard, but the ice didn't crack.

77
00:04:45,123 --> 00:04:47,468
"It's solid," he said.

78
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:52,857
The travelers stepped onto the ice and started walking.

79
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:57,503
After a few hours, the riverbank was no longer in sight.

80
00:04:57,504 --> 00:05:02,214
Suddenly there was a rumbling sound, and the ice shook.

81
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:05,073
"What caused that?" asked the monk.

82
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:08,991
"I don't know," said Wukong, "But we should be—"

83
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:17,853
[i@Crack!@i] Underneath them, the ice split wide open!
