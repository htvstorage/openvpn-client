1
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:18,344
The Tang Monk jumped to his feet as the villagers hid behind trees.

2
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:22,424
Wukong, Wujing, and Bajie pulled out their weapons.

3
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:26,008
A large shell rose from the water.

4
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:29,354
"It's a giant turtle!" said Bajie.

5
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:32,440
The turtle bowed its head toward Wukong.

6
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:36,095
"That demon had taken over my house and river.

7
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,807
Thank you for getting rid of him."

8
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:41,772
The turtle then looked at the villagers.

9
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:44,807
[g@"You don't need to make a boat.

10
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:48,373
I can take the travelers across the river."@g]

11
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:50,967
[g@"That's wonderful!" said the Tang Monk.

12
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,355
"I'm from the Tang Empire, andâ€”"@g]

13
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:57,031
"I know who you are," interrupted the turtle.

14
00:00:57,032 --> 00:01:01,990
"You're traveling to the Western Paradise to get scriptures from Buddha.

15
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:05,612
[g@I knew you would cross my river eventually.

16
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:08,303
Climb onto my shell."@g]

17
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:11,532
[g@Wukong eyed the turtle suspiciously.

18
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:14,352
"How do we know we can trust you?@g]

19
00:01:14,353 --> 00:01:19,096
Demons all along the way are waiting for my master to pass by."

20
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:22,804
"They all want to eat him," added Bajie.

21
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:27,945
"I promise I won't hurt the Tang Monk," said the turtle.

22
00:01:27,946 --> 00:01:34,961
"I want to help him reach the Western Paradise."

23
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:41,138
After a little more hesitation, the travelers [n@stepped onto the turtle's shell.

24
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:44,080
The turtle began to paddle.

25
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:48,201
The villagers came out from behind the trees and waved.

26
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:50,923
"Good-bye!" called a woman.

27
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:55,423
"Please visit us on your way home!" shouted someone else.

28
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:58,737
"We will, I promise!" called the monk.

29
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:02,074
[g@Soon the turtle was far from shore.

30
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:04,468
Bajie fell asleep.@g]

31
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,426
The turtle glanced back at the Tang Monk.

32
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:11,423
"Excuse me, but can you do me a favor?"

33
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:13,755
[g@"Of course," said the monk.

34
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:16,006
"What do you need me to do?"@g]

35
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:20,829
"I have been a good Buddhist for over a thousand years," said the turtle.

36
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,393
"But sadly I'm still just a turtle.

37
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:28,260
Can you ask Buddha when I will be reborn as a human?"

38
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:29,889
[g@The Tang Monk nodded.

39
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,117
"I will ask him."@g]

40
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:36,803
A few hours later, the turtle reached the other side of the river.

41
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:41,352
The travelers stepped onto dry land.

42
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:44,202
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

43
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:46,799
"You're welcome," said the turtle.

44
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,141
"Please don't forget to ask Buddha about me."

45
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:55,109
The turtle disappeared under the water.

46
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,952
The Tang Monk climbed onto the horse, and the group continued on the road.

47
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:05,181
[g@As usual, Bajie soon started complaining.

48
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:07,943
"I'm tired of walking already.@g]

49
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:11,927
I wish we could ride that turtle the whole way to the West."

50
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:15,450
[g@"Stop complaining," said Wukong.

51
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:19,352
"Be happy that the road is flat here."@g]

52
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:22,260
They walked for another couple of hours.

53
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:27,534
The road started to go up a mountain, getting steeper and steeper.

54
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:32,513
The pig moaned, "The road isn't flat anymore!"

55
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:36,052
A cold wind whipped past them.

56
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:38,700
"Brr!" Wujing shivered.

57
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:41,881
"Look!" said the Tang Monk, pointing.

58
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:45,741
[g@Higher up the mountain was a large monastery.

59
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:48,003
"Maybe we can rest there."@g]

60
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:50,834
[g@Wukong looked at the monastery.

61
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:54,875
A dark mist hung over it.@g]

62
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:56,822
The monkey shook his head.

63
00:03:56,823 --> 00:03:58,672
[g@"That's a bad place.

64
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:00,416
We're not going there."@g]

65
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:03,378
"It looks fine to me," said the monk.

66
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:07,272
"I can see things that humans can't see," said Wukong.

67
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:10,513
"And I see a dark mist hanging over that monastery.

68
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:13,233
A demon could be in there."

69
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:15,942
There was a sudden growling sound.

70
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:19,205
Wukong looked around to see what had caused it.

71
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:21,316
[g@Bajie patted his stomach.

72
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:25,255
"Sorry, I'm a bit hungry."@g]

73
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:28,652
"We're all tired and hungry," said the Tang Monk.

74
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:31,049
"We should just go to that monastery."

75
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,667
[g@"No," said Wukong sharply. "Stay here.

76
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:36,813
I will find food for us."@g]

77
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:49,307
He looked at the monk and warned him again, "Do not go to that monastery!"
