The Tang Monk jumped to his feet as the villagers hid behind trees.

2
202:10:11,066.66700005531311 --> 315:28:31,066.66700005531311
Wukong, Wujing, and Bajie pulled out their weapons.

3
315:30:11,066.66700005531311 --> 415:01:51,066.66700005531311
A large shell rose from the water.

4
415:03:31,066.66700005531311 --> 507:58:31,066.66700005531311
"It's a giant turtle!" said Bajie.

5
508:00:11,066.66700005531311 --> 593:41:51,066.66700005531311
The turtle bowed its head toward Wukong.

593:43:31,066.66700005531311 --> 695:13:31,066.66699981689453
"That demon had taken over my house and river.

695:15:11,066.66699981689453 --> 770:33:31,066.66699981689453
Thank you for getting rid of him."

770:35:11,066.66699981689453 --> 852:55:11,066.66699981689453
The turtle then looked at the villagers.

9
852:56:51,066.66699981689453 --> 937:13:31,066.66699981689453

1036:18:31,066.66699981689453 --> 1108:20:11,066.66699981689453
[g@"That's wonderful!" said the Tang Monk.

12
1108:21:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1174:40:11,066.66699981689453

1174:41:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1276:46:51,066.66699981689453
"I know who you are," interrupted the turtle.

14
1276:48:31,066.66699981689453 --> 1414:31:51,066.66699981689453
"You're traveling to the Western Paradise to get scriptures from Buddha.

1589:55:11,066.66699981689453 --> 1679:35:11,066.66699981689453
[g@Wukong eyed the turtle suspiciously.

18
1679:36:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1757:55:11,066.66699981689453
"How do we know we can trust you?@g]

19
1757:56:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1889:41:51,066.66699981689453
Demons all along the way are waiting for my master to pass by."

20
1889:43:31,066.66699981689453 --> 1992:41:51,066.66699981689453
"They all want to eat him," added Bajie.

21
1992:43:31,066.66699981689453 --> 2135:30:11,066.66699981689453
"I promise I won't hurt the Tang Monk," said the turtle.

22
2135:31:51,066.66699981689453 --> 2330:23:31,066.66699981689453
"I want to help him reach the Western Paradise."

23
2330:25:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2501:58:31,066.66699981689453
After a little more hesitation, the travelers [n@stepped onto the turtle's shell.

24
2502:00:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2583:41:51,066.66699981689453
The turtle began to paddle.

25
2583:43:31,066.66699981689453 --> 2698:10:11,066.66699981689453
The villagers came out from behind the trees and waved.

26
2698:11:51,066.66699981689453 --> 2773:46:51,066.66699981689453
"Good-bye!" called a woman.

27
2773:48:31,066.66699981689453 --> 2898:46:51,066.66699981689453
"Please visit us on your way home!" shouted someone else.

28
2898:48:31,066.66699981689453 --> 2990:50:11,066.66699981689453
"We will, I promise!" called the monk.

29
2990:51:51,066.66699981689453 --> 3083:31:51,066.66699981689453
[g@Soon the turtle was far from shore.

30
3083:33:31,066.66699981689453 --> 3150:01:51,066.66699981689453
Bajie fell asleep.@g]

3150:03:31,066.66699981689453 --> 3232:11:51,066.66699981689453
The turtle glanced back at the Tang Monk.

32
3232:13:31,066.66699981689453 --> 3343:13:31,066.66699981689453
"Excuse me, but can you do me a favor?"

33
3343:15:11,066.66699981689453 --> 3408:00:11,066.66699981689453
[g@"Of course," said the monk.

34
3408:01:51,066.66699981689453 --> 3470:31:51,066.66699981689453
"What do you need me to do?"@g]

3470:33:31,066.66699981689453 --> 3604:30:11,066.66699981689453
"I have been a good Buddhist for over a thousand years," said the turtle.

36
3604:31:51,066.66699981689453 --> 3703:30:11,066.66699981689453
"But sadly I'm still just a turtle.

37
3703:31:51,066.66699981689453 --> 3810:55:11,066.66699981689453
Can you ask Buddha when I will be reborn as a human?"

38
3810:56:51,066.66699981689453 --> 3856:10:11,066.66699981689453
[g@The Tang Monk nodded.

39
3856:11:51,066.66699981689453 --> 3918:03:31,066.66699981689453
"I will ask him."@g]

3918:05:11,066.66699981689453 --> 4048:13:31,066.66699981689453
A few hours later, the turtle reached the other side of the river.

41
4048:15:11,066.66699981689453 --> 4174:35:11,066.66699981689453
The travelers stepped onto dry land.

42
4174:36:51,066.66699981689453 --> 4253:45:11,066.66699981689453
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

43
4253:46:51,066.66699981689453 --> 4325:53:31,066.66699981689453
"You're welcome," said the turtle.

44
4325:55:11,066.66699981689453 --> 4418:43:31,066.66699981689453
"Please don't forget to ask Buddha about me."

45
4418:45:11,066.66699981689453 --> 4556:43:31,066.66699981689453
The turtle disappeared under the water.

46
4556:45:11,066.66699981689453 --> 4719:01:51,066.66699981689453
The Tang Monk climbed onto the horse, and the group continued on the road.

47
4719:03:31,066.66699981689453 --> 4836:30:11,066.66699981689453
[g@As usual, Bajie soon started complaining.

48
4836:31:51,066.66699981689453 --> 4913:13:31,066.66699981689453
"I'm tired of walking already.@g]

49
4913:15:11,066.66699981689453 --> 5023:53:31,066.66699981689453
I wish we could ride that turtle the whole way to the West."

50
5023:55:11,066.66699981689453 --> 5121:45:11,066.66699981689453
[g@"Stop complaining," said Wukong.

51
5121:46:51,066.66699981689453 --> 5230:08:31,066.66699981689453
"Be happy that the road is flat here."@g]

52
5230:10:11,066.66699981689453 --> 5310:55:11,066.66699981689453
They walked for another couple of hours.

53
5310:56:51,066.66699981689453 --> 5457:25:11,066.66699981689453
The road started to go up a mountain, getting steeper and steeper.

54
5457:26:51,066.66699981689453 --> 5595:43:31,066.66699981689453
The pig moaned, "The road isn't flat anymore!"

55
5595:45:11,066.66699981689453 --> 5694:01:51,066.66699981689453
A cold wind whipped past them.

5694:03:31,066.66699981689453 --> 5767:35:11,066.66699981689453
"Brr!" Wujing shivered.

57
5767:36:51,066.66699981689453 --> 5855:56:51,066.66699981689453
"Look!" said the Tang Monk, pointing.

58
5855:58:31,066.66699981689453 --> 5963:10:11,066.66699981689453
[g@Higher up the mountain was a large monastery.

6026:01:51,066.66699981689453 --> 6104:38:31,066.66699981689453
[g@Wukong looked at the monastery.

6104:40:11,066.66699981689453 --> 6216:53:31,066.66699981689453

The monkey shook his head.

63
6271:00:11,066.66699981689453 --> 6322:21:51,066.66699981689453

6370:50:11,066.66699981689453 --> 6453:05:11,066.66699981689453
"It looks fine to me," said the monk.

66
6453:06:51,066.66699981689453 --> 6561:15:11,066.66699981689453
"I can see things that humans can't see," said Wukong.

67
6561:16:51,066.66699981689453 --> 6651:16:51,066.66699981689453
"And I see a dark mist hanging over that monastery.

6651:18:31,066.66699981689453 --> 6726:50:11,066.66699981689453
A demon could be in there."

69
6726:51:51,066.66699981689453 --> 6802:05:11,066.66699981689453
There was a sudden growling sound.

70
6802:06:51,066.66699981689453 --> 6892:43:31,066.66699981689453
Wukong looked around to see what had caused it.

71
6892:45:11,066.66699981689453 --> 6951:21:51,066.66699981689453
[g@Bajie patted his stomach.

"We're all tired and hungry," said the Tang Monk.

74
7155:10:11,066.66699981689453 --> 7221:43:31,066.66699981689453
"We should just go to that monastery."

7221:45:11,066.66699981689453 --> 7322:13:31,066.66699981689453
[g@"No," said Wukong sharply. "Stay here.

7381:51:51,066.66699981689453 --> 7728:53:31,066.66699981689453
He looked at the monk and warned him again, "Do not go to that monastery!"
