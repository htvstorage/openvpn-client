00:00:11,200 --> 142:26:51,200
"What's wrong with our swords and spears?" asked the gibbon.

2
142:28:31,200 --> 252:08:31,200
"They're fine for normal monkeys and apes," said Wukong.

3
252:10:11,200 --> 305:33:31,200
[g@"But I am very powerful.

4
305:35:11,200 --> 373:21:51,200
I need a much heavier weapon."@g]

5
373:23:31,200 --> 448:53:31,200
The gibbon thought for a minute.

6
448:55:11,200 --> 564:08:31,200
"A dragon king lives at the bottom of the Eastern Sea," he said.

7
564:10:11,200 --> 641:50:11,200
"Maybe he has a weapon you can use."

8
641:51:51,200 --> 713:26:51,200
[g@"That's a good idea," said Wukong.

9
713:28:31,200 --> 882:55:11,200
"I'll be back soon!"@g]

10
882:56:51,200 --> 1024:56:51,200
He said a quick spell so he could breathe underwater.

11
1024:58:31,200 --> 1217:25:11,200
Then he dived into the stream.

12
1217:26:51,200 --> 1403:50:11,200
He swam to the ocean and went deeper and deeper.

13
1403:51:51,200 --> 1505:03:31,200
Soon he arrived at a large palace.

14
1505:05:11,200 --> 1640:38:31,200
The Dragon King and the Dragon Queen were sitting at a table, having tea.

15
1640:40:11,200 --> 1749:06:51,200
The Dragon King looked over when Wukong walked in.

16
1749:08:31,200 --> 1837:06:51,200
"Who are you?" asked the Dragon King.

17
1837:08:31,200 --> 1948:21:51,200
"I'm king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain," said Wukong.

18
1948:23:31,200 --> 2009:58:31,200
"My name is Sun Wukong."

19
2010:00:11,200 --> 2098:31:51,200
[g@"It's nice to meet you," said the queen.

20
2098:33:31,200 --> 2167:40:11,200
"Would you like some tea?"@g]

21
2167:41:51,200 --> 2234:36:51,200
"No, thank you," said Wukong.

22
2234:38:31,200 --> 2377:08:31,200
[g@"I need a heavy weapon because I'm as strong as a god.

23
2377:10:11,200 --> 2441:01:51,200
I want one of yours."@g]

24
2441:03:31,200 --> 2619:08:31,200
"Well," said the Dragon King, "I suppose I could find a weapon for you."

25
2619:10:11,200 --> 2725:26:51,200
The Dragon King looked at a turtle soldier.

26
2725:28:31,200 --> 2828:11:51,200
"Find a heavy weapon for Sun Wukong."

27
2828:13:31,200 --> 2920:41:51,200
The turtle went out of the room.

28
2920:43:31,200 --> 3093:23:31,200
He soon came back, slowly dragging a huge sword.

29
3093:25:11,200 --> 3308:03:31,200
He dropped the sword and then fell down, out of breath.

30
3308:05:11,200 --> 3426:58:31,200
Wukong picked up the sword with no trouble at all.

31
3427:00:11,200 --> 3600:20:11,200
[i@Swish!@i] [i@Swoosh!@i] He waved the sword through the air, pretending to fight.

32
3600:21:51,200 --> 3691:20:11,200
[g@"This sword is too light," said Wukong.

33
3691:21:51,200 --> 3777:08:31,200
"Find me a better weapon!"@g]

34
3777:10:11,200 --> 3923:45:11,200
"This monkey is rude," the Dragon Queen whispered to her husband.

35
3923:46:51,200 --> 4021:16:51,200
"You're right, dear," the Dragon King whispered back.

36
4021:18:31,200 --> 4142:20:11,200
"Let's find him something quickly so he'll leave."

37
4142:21:51,200 --> 4379:03:31,200
A few minutes later, several turtles and octopuses [n@dragged an enormous spear into the room.

38
4379:05:11,200 --> 4460:01:51,200
"There," said the Dragon King.

39
4460:03:31,200 --> 4624:06:51,200
"That looks like a very heavy weapon. Right, Wukong?"

40
4624:08:31,200 --> 4785:20:11,200
Wukong lifted the spear and began stabbing at the air.

41
4785:21:51,200 --> 4839:03:31,200
[g@He shook his head.

42
4839:05:11,200 --> 4910:18:31,200
"This spear is too light."@g]

43
4910:20:11,200 --> 4975:06:51,200
The Dragon King snorted.

44
4975:08:31,200 --> 5043:16:51,200
[g@"That spear is very heavy!

45
5043:18:31,200 --> 5128:46:51,200
How can you say it's too light?"@g]

46
5128:48:31,200 --> 5250:50:11,200
[g@"To me, it's light," said Wukong.

47
5250:51:51,200 --> 5354:28:31,200
"Find me something else!"@g]

48
5354:30:11,200 --> 5467:30:11,200
"We don't have anything else," said the Dragon King.

49
5467:31:51,200 --> 5563:10:11,200
"That's the heaviest weapon we have."

50
5563:11:51,200 --> 5626:10:11,200
[g@Wukong stomped his foot.

51
5626:11:51,200 --> 5770:28:31,200
"I'm not leaving until I get what I want!"@g]

52
5770:30:11,200 --> 5875:20:11,200
"This is an outrage!" said the Dragon King.

53
5875:21:51,200 --> 5952:50:11,200
The queen whispered to him again.

54
5952:51:51,200 --> 6065:33:31,200
"What about the magical iron bar in the treasury?

55
6065:35:11,200 --> 6151:26:51,200
I'm sure that's heavy enough."

56
6151:28:31,200 --> 6259:13:31,200
"We can't give that to him," said the Dragon King.

57
6259:15:11,200 --> 6335:43:31,200
"It's a treasure from Heaven."

58
6335:45:11,200 --> 6420:38:31,200
[g@"Who cares?" said the queen.

59
6420:40:11,200 --> 6563:11:51,200
"I just want this monkey out of my palace!"@g]

60
6563:13:31,200 --> 6638:16:51,200
The Dragon King sighed.

61
6638:18:31,200 --> 6762:56:51,200
"Wukong, we might have something heavy enough for you."

62
6762:58:31,200 --> 6835:40:11,200
"Bring it here," said Wukong.

63
6835:41:51,200 --> 6908:36:51,200
[g@"We can't," said the Dragon King.

64
6908:38:31,200 --> 6993:58:31,200
"It's too heavy for anyone to lift.@g]

65
6994:00:11,200 --> 7095:33:31,200
But if you can lift it, we'll let you have it."

66
7095:35:11,200 --> 7208:00:11,200
"Show me where it is," said Wukong.

67
7208:01:51,200 --> 7334:31:51,200
The group went to the treasury.

68
7334:33:31,200 --> 7450:25:11,200
An enormous iron pillar stood in the center of the room.

69
7450:26:51,200 --> 7545:35:11,200
Beams of golden light shone from it.

70
7545:36:51,200 --> 7735:56:51,200
"That pillar was used to measure all the oceans [n@and rivers," said the Dragon King.

71
7735:58:31,200 --> 7871:50:11,200
Wukong went closer and looked up at the large piece of iron.

72
7871:51:51,200 --> 7963:41:51,200
[g@The Dragon King folded his arms.

73
7963:43:31,200 --> 8245:25:11,200
"If you can pick it up, you can have it."@g]
