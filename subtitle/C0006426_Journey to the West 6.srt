1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,328
"What's wrong with our swords and spears?" asked the gibbon.

2
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,277
"They're fine for normal monkeys and apes," said Wukong.

3
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:22,200
"But I am very powerful.

4
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:24,641
I need a much heavier weapon."

5
00:00:24,642 --> 00:00:27,360
The gibbon thought for a minute.

6
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,509
"A dragon king lives at the bottom of the Eastern Sea," he said.

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,306
"Maybe he has a weapon you can use."

8
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:36,884
"That's a good idea," said Wukong.

9
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:42,985
"I'll be back soon!"

10
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:48,098
He said a quick spell so he could breathe underwater.

11
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:55,027
Then he dived into the stream.

12
00:00:55,028 --> 00:01:01,738
He swam to the ocean and went deeper and deeper.

13
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,382
Soon he arrived at a large palace.

14
00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:10,263
The Dragon King and the Dragon Queen were sitting at a table, having tea.

15
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:14,168
The Dragon King looked over when Wukong walked in.

16
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:17,336
"Who are you?" asked the Dragon King.

17
00:01:17,337 --> 00:01:21,341
"I'm king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain," said Wukong.

18
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:23,559
"My name is Sun Wukong."

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,747
"It's nice to meet you," said the queen.

20
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:29,236
"Would you like some tea?"

21
00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:31,646
"No, thank you," said Wukong.

22
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:36,777
"I need a heavy weapon because I'm as strong as a god.

23
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:39,077
I want one of yours."

24
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:45,489
"Well," said the Dragon King, "I suppose I could find a weapon for you."

25
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,316
The Dragon King looked at a turtle soldier.

26
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:53,015
"Find a heavy weapon for Sun Wukong."

27
00:01:53,016 --> 00:01:56,345
The turtle went out of the room.

28
00:01:56,346 --> 00:02:02,562
He soon came back, slowly dragging a huge sword.

29
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:10,290
He dropped the sword and then fell down, out of breath.

30
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:14,571
Wukong picked up the sword with no trouble at all.

31
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:20,812
Swish! Swoosh! He waved the sword through the air, pretending to fight.

32
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:24,088
"This sword is too light," said Wukong.

33
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:27,177
"Find me a better weapon!"

34
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:32,455
"This monkey is rude," the Dragon Queen whispered to her husband.

35
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:35,966
"You're right, dear," the Dragon King whispered back.

36
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:40,324
"Let's find him something quickly so he'll leave."

37
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:48,846
A few minutes later, several turtles and octopuses dragged an enormous spear into the room.

38
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:51,761
"There," said the Dragon King.

39
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:57,668
"That looks like a very heavy weapon. Right, Wukong?"

40
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:03,472
Wukong lifted the spear and began stabbing at the air.

41
00:03:03,473 --> 00:03:05,406
He shook his head.

42
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:07,971
"This spear is too light."

43
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:10,304
The Dragon King snorted.

44
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:12,758
"That spear is very heavy!

45
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,836
How can you say it's too light?"

46
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:20,230
"To me, it's light," said Wukong.

47
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:23,961
"Find me something else!"

48
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:28,030
"We don't have anything else," said the Dragon King.

49
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:31,474
"That's the heaviest weapon we have."

50
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:33,742
Wukong stomped his foot.

51
00:03:33,743 --> 00:03:38,937
"I'm not leaving until I get what I want!"

52
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:42,712
"This is an outrage!" said the Dragon King.

53
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:45,502
The queen whispered to him again.

54
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:49,560
"What about the magical iron bar in the treasury?

55
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:52,652
I'm sure that's heavy enough."

56
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:56,532
"We can't give that to him," said the Dragon King.

57
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:59,286
"It's a treasure from Heaven."

58
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:02,343
"Who cares?" said the queen.

59
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:07,475
"I just want this monkey out of my palace!"

60
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:10,178
The Dragon King sighed.

61
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:14,666
"Wukong, we might have something heavy enough for you."

62
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,284
"Bring it here," said Wukong.

63
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:19,910
"We can't," said the Dragon King.

64
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:22,983
"It's too heavy for anyone to lift.

65
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:26,640
But if you can lift it, we'll let you have it."

66
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,688
"Show me where it is," said Wukong.

67
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:35,243
The group went to the treasury.

68
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:39,415
An enormous iron pillar stood in the center of the room.

69
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,841
Beams of golden light shone from it.

70
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:49,694
"That pillar was used to measure all the oceans and rivers," said the Dragon King.

71
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:54,586
Wukong went closer and looked up at the large piece of iron.

72
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:57,893
The Dragon King folded his arms.

73
00:04:57,894 --> 00:05:08,035
"If you can pick it up, you can have it."
