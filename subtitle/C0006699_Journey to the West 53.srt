1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,689
From behind Guanyin, Wukong peeked at Red Boy.

2
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,172
The demon was trapped by the swords, all pointed at his face.

3
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:24,568
"Get these swords away from me!" cried the demon.

4
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:27,574
"You must become a Buddhist," said Guanyin.

5
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:30,340
"Then I'll release you."

6
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:32,588
"I promise!" cried Red Boy.

7
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:35,690
"I'll do whatever you say!"

8
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:42,137
Guanyin recited a spell, and the swords vanished.

9
00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:46,825
Red Boy's eyes flashed with anger.

10
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:50,025
"Bodhisattva, watch out!" cried Wukong.

11
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:54,787
Red Boy charged toward Guanyin.

12
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,882
Wukong jumped in front of him.

13
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:03,500
The monkey was about to strike the demon when Guanyin held up five metal bands.

14
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:07,483
She threw them at Red Boy.

15
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:12,330
Instantly they clamped around his head, wrists, and ankles.

16
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:15,047
"Evil demon!" said Guanyin.

17
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:17,903
"How dare you try to attack me!"

18
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:22,621
Unable to move, Red Boy glared at Guanyin.

19
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:26,790
Wukong raised his iron bar to strike him.

20
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:31,070
"No, Wukong," said Guanyin. "Don't hurt the demon.

21
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:37,426
I will take him back to Mount Potalaka to be my student."

22
00:01:37,427 --> 00:01:40,892
"Yes, Bodhisattva," said the monkey.

23
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:45,383
Guanyin took the vase down to earth.

24
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:57,641
She recited a spell, and all the water flowed back into the vase.

25
00:01:57,642 --> 00:02:02,519
She then led Red Boy toward the south.

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,033
Wukong went into Red Boy's cave and freed the Tang Monk.

27
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:11,029
Then he found Bajie and freed him.

28
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,164
The three of them went down the mountain and found Wujing.

29
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:19,257
The group continued west.

30
00:02:19,258 --> 00:02:24,625
They traveled for weeks and then months.

31
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:28,021
One day they came to a wide river.

32
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:33,104
"I can't believe we have to cross another river," muttered Bajie.

33
00:02:33,105 --> 00:02:37,390
"There are many rivers between here and the West," said Wukong.

34
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,595
"We'll have to cross them all."

35
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:43,760
"How will we cross this one?" asked the Tang Monk.

36
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,701
A small canoe came into view.

37
00:02:46,702 --> 00:02:49,949
A man paddled it toward the travelers.

38
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,522
As the man paddled, he stared at the Tang Monk.

39
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:59,216
"Greetings!" called the man as he came closer.

40
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:02,505
"Do you all need a ride across the river?"

41
00:03:02,506 --> 00:03:05,091
"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

42
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:08,198
"We were just wondering how we would get across.

43
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,801
We're going to the West to get scriptures from Buddha."

44
00:03:11,802 --> 00:03:15,741
"You must be the Tang Monk!" said the man brightly.

45
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:19,880
"I've heard you would pass through this area eventually."

46
00:03:19,881 --> 00:03:22,829
"Really?" asked the Tang Monk.

47
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,515
"Yes," said the man with a smile. "You're famous."

48
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:30,538
He glanced down at his canoe.

49
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:33,522
"I would be happy to take you all across.

50
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:37,182
But as you can see, my canoe is not very big.

51
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,947
I can take only two passengers at a time."

52
00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:45,105
As the man talked, Wukong watched him carefully.

53
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:48,983
Something about the man didn't look quite right.

54
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:53,491
The monkey was about to say something when Bajie stepped forward.

55
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:57,001
"The Tang Monk and I will go first," said the pig.

56
00:03:57,002 --> 00:04:02,745
Wukong hesitated. "Master, I don't think this is a good idea."

57
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:04,738
The Tang Monk frowned.

58
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,195
"You never trust people, Wukong.

59
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:12,358
This kind man is willing to help us cross the river."

60
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:18,706
The monkey bit his lip as the monk and Bajie climbed into the canoe.

61
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:23,866
They sat down, and the man paddled away from shore.

62
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:27,726
Wukong watched the canoe glide across the river.

63
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:32,775
When it was about halfway across, Wukong noticed something.

64
00:04:32,776 --> 00:04:37,411
"Am I imagining things, or is the canoe sinking?" asked the monkey.

65
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:42,355
Wujing looked. "You're not imagining things," he said.

66
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:45,055
"It is sinking!"

67
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:49,673
The two of them watched as the canoe slipped under the surface of the water.

68
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:52,292
Wukong stamped his foot.

69
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:55,595
"That man kidnapped Master and Bajie!

70
00:04:55,596 --> 00:05:00,922
I knew he looked suspicious!"
