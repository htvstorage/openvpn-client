1
00:00:11,000 --> 158:01:51,000
From behind Guanyin, Wukong peeked at Red Boy.

2
158:03:31,000 --> 282:33:31,000
The demon was trapped by the swords, all pointed at his face.

3
282:35:11,000 --> 376:53:31,000
"Get these swords away from me!" cried the demon.

4
376:55:11,000 --> 460:23:31,000
[g@"You must become a Buddhist," said Guanyin.

5
460:25:11,000 --> 537:13:31,000
"Then I'll release you."@g]

6
537:15:11,000 --> 599:40:11,000
[g@"I promise!" cried Red Boy.

7
599:41:51,000 --> 685:50:11,000
"I'll do whatever you say!"@g]

8
685:51:51,000 --> 864:55:11,000
Guanyin recited a spell, and the swords vanished.

9
864:56:51,000 --> 995:08:31,000
Red Boy's eyes flashed with anger.

10
995:10:11,000 --> 1084:01:51,000
"Bodhisattva, watch out!" cried Wukong.

11
1084:03:31,000 --> 1216:18:31,000
[g@Red Boy charged toward Guanyin.

12
1216:20:11,000 --> 1302:16:51,000
Wukong jumped in front of him.@g]

13
1302:18:31,000 --> 1458:20:11,000
The monkey was about to strike the demon when [n@Guanyin held up five metal bands.

14
1458:21:51,000 --> 1568:58:31,000
She threw them at Red Boy.

15
1569:00:11,000 --> 1703:36:51,000
Instantly they clamped around his head, wrists, and ankles.

16
1703:38:31,000 --> 1779:05:11,000
[g@"Evil demon!" said Guanyin.

17
1779:06:51,000 --> 1858:25:11,000
"How dare you try to attack me!"@g]

18
1858:26:51,000 --> 1989:28:31,000
Unable to move, Red Boy glared at Guanyin.

19
1989:30:11,000 --> 2105:16:51,000
Wukong raised his iron bar to strike him.

20
2105:18:31,000 --> 2224:10:11,000
"No, Wukong," said Guanyin. "Don't hurt the demon.

21
2224:11:51,000 --> 2400:43:31,000
I will take him back to Mount Potalaka to be my student."

22
2400:45:11,000 --> 2497:00:11,000
"Yes, Bodhisattva," said the monkey.

23
2497:01:51,000 --> 2621:45:11,000
Guanyin took the vase down to earth.

24
2621:46:51,000 --> 2962:15:11,000
She recited a spell, and all the water flowed back into the vase.

25
2962:16:51,000 --> 3097:45:11,000
She then led Red Boy toward the south.

26
3097:46:51,000 --> 3223:08:31,000
Wukong went into Red Boy's cave and freed the Tang Monk.

27
3223:10:11,000 --> 3334:08:31,000
Then he found Bajie and freed him.

28
3334:10:11,000 --> 3476:46:51,000
The three of them went down the mountain and found Wujing.

29
3476:48:31,000 --> 3562:41:51,000
[g@The group continued west.

30
3562:43:31,000 --> 3711:48:31,000
They traveled for weeks and then months.@g]

31
3711:50:11,000 --> 3806:08:31,000
One day they came to a wide river.

32
3806:10:11,000 --> 3947:20:11,000
"I can't believe we have to cross another river," muttered Bajie.

33
3947:21:51,000 --> 4066:23:31,000
"There are many rivers between here and the West," said Wukong.

34
4066:25:11,000 --> 4127:38:31,000
"We'll have to cross them all."

35
4127:40:11,000 --> 4243:20:11,000
"How will we cross this one?" asked the Tang Monk.

36
4243:21:51,000 --> 4325:01:51,000
[g@A small canoe came into view.

37
4325:03:31,000 --> 4415:15:11,000
A man paddled it toward the travelers.@g]

38
4415:16:51,000 --> 4570:03:31,000
As the man paddled, he stared at the Tang Monk.

39
4570:05:11,000 --> 4672:40:11,000
"Greetings!" called the man as he came closer.

40
4672:41:51,000 --> 4764:01:51,000
"Do you all need a ride across the river?"

41
4764:03:31,000 --> 4835:51:51,000
"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

42
4835:53:31,000 --> 4922:10:11,000
"We were just wondering how we would get across.

43
4922:11:51,000 --> 5022:15:11,000
We're going to the West to get scriptures from Buddha."

44
5022:16:51,000 --> 5131:41:51,000
"You must be the Tang Monk!" said the man brightly.

45
5131:43:31,000 --> 5246:40:11,000
"I've heard you would pass through this area eventually."

46
5246:41:51,000 --> 5328:35:11,000
"Really?" asked the Tang Monk.

47
5328:36:51,000 --> 5458:45:11,000
"Yes," said the man with a smile. "You're famous."

48
5458:46:51,000 --> 5542:43:31,000
[g@He glanced down at his canoe.

49
5542:45:11,000 --> 5625:36:51,000
"I would be happy to take you all across.@g]

50
5625:38:31,000 --> 5727:16:51,000
But as you can see, my canoe is not very big.

51
5727:18:31,000 --> 5831:51:51,000
I can take only two passengers at a time."

52
5831:53:31,000 --> 5947:21:51,000
As the man talked, Wukong watched him carefully.

53
5947:23:31,000 --> 6055:05:11,000
Something about the man didn't look quite right.

54
6055:06:51,000 --> 6180:18:31,000
The monkey was about to say something when Bajie stepped forward.

55
6180:20:11,000 --> 6277:48:31,000
"The Tang Monk and I will go first," said the pig.

56
6277:50:11,000 --> 6437:21:51,000
Wukong hesitated. "Master, I don't think this is a good idea."

57
6437:23:31,000 --> 6492:43:31,000
[g@The Tang Monk frowned.

58
6492:45:11,000 --> 6560:58:31,000
"You never trust people, Wukong.@g]

59
6561:00:11,000 --> 6704:23:31,000
This kind man is willing to help us cross the river."

60
6704:25:11,000 --> 6880:43:31,000
The monkey bit his lip as the monk and Bajie climbed into the canoe.

61
6880:45:11,000 --> 7024:03:31,000
They sat down, and the man paddled away from shore.

62
7024:05:11,000 --> 7131:16:51,000
Wukong watched the canoe glide across the river.

63
7131:18:31,000 --> 7271:31:51,000
When it was about halfway across, Wukong noticed something.

64
7271:33:31,000 --> 7400:18:31,000
"Am I imagining things, or is the canoe sinking?" asked the monkey.

65
7400:20:11,000 --> 7537:38:31,000
[g@Wujing looked. "You're not imagining things," he said.

66
7537:40:11,000 --> 7612:38:31,000
"It is sinking!"@g]

67
7612:40:11,000 --> 7740:55:11,000
The two of them watched as the canoe slipped under the surface of the water.

68
7740:56:51,000 --> 7813:40:11,000
Wukong stamped his foot.

69
7813:41:51,000 --> 7905:25:11,000
[g@"That man kidnapped Master and Bajie!

70
7905:26:51,000 --> 8053:23:31,000
I knew he looked suspicious!"@g]
