1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,164
Golden Horn scowled at Wukong.

2
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:19,061
"I doubt you have a gourd like mine."

3
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,982
"I do," said Wukong.

4
00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:24,607
He held up the real gourd.

5
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,473
The demon looked carefully at the gourd.

6
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:30,961
"That does look like my gourd.

7
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:34,514
But my gourd is magical."

8
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:37,714
"My gourd is magical too," said Wukong.

9
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:39,647
The demon rubbed his chin.

10
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:43,119
"What can your gourd do?"

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,106
"It can hold a demon," said Wukong.

12
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:48,798
"All I have to do is say the demon's name.

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,565
The demon will get sucked in and then turn into liquid."

14
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:55,243
Golden Horn raised his eyebrows.

15
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:58,659
"My gourd can do that too.

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,277
Let's see whose gourd works better.

17
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:05,852
I'll go first.

18
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:10,044
Um, I forgot your name."

19
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:13,250
"Kong Sunwu," said Wukong.

20
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:17,056
"Oh yes. Now I remember."

21
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:22,687
Golden Horn held up his gourd. "Kong Sunwu!"

22
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,569
Nothing happened.

23
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,803
Golden Horn looked at his gourd.

24
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:32,800
"Why isn't my gourd working?"

25
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:39,458
"Let me try mine," said Wukong. "Golden Horn!"

26
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:44,023
Shloomp! Instantly the demon was sucked into the gourd.

27
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:46,267
"Ha-ha!" Wukong laughed.

28
00:01:46,268 --> 00:01:50,128
"Golden Horn will soon be turned into liquid!"

29
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:54,234
He closed the gourd and ran into the cave.

30
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:59,136
Several demons were inside.

31
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:02,077
The monkey waved his iron bar at them.

32
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,376
"Get out of here before I clobber you all!" he shouted.

33
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:13,197
"Ahh!" The demons screamed and ran out of the cave.

34
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:19,758
After a quick search of the cave, Wukong found his companions.

35
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,795
"We thought you were trapped under mountains," said the Tang Monk.

36
00:02:23,796 --> 00:02:28,225
"I was freed a couple of hours ago," said Wukong.

37
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:30,504
He untied the monk.

38
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:33,891
"A couple of hours ago?" asked Bajie.

39
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:36,690
"What were you doing for all that time?

40
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:40,620
We were scared to death in here!"

41
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:42,099
Wukong shrugged.

42
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,125
"I couldn't free you right away.

43
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:48,747
I had to get rid of the demon first."

44
00:02:48,748 --> 00:02:54,181
The monkey untied Bajie and Wujing.

45
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:57,600
They all went outside.

46
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:01,209
"It's still early in the afternoon," said Wujing.

47
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,059
"Let's start walking now."

48
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,395
"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

49
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:12,690
"I want to be as far from this mountain as I can by nighttime."

50
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:16,818
The travelers hurried west along the road.

51
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:22,077
They hadn't gone far when an old man approached them.

52
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:26,055
"Give me back my gourd!" said the old man.

53
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:28,560
Wukong stepped forward.

54
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:31,455
"What gourd? I don't have a gourd."

55
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,413
"I know you have my gourd," said the man.

56
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:39,166
"I don't know what you're talking about," said the monkey.

57
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:41,783
There was a flash of light.

58
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:45,622
Then Laozi the sage stood before the travelers.

59
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:47,578
He looked angry.

60
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,473
"Give me my gourd, Wukong!" boomed the sage.

61
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:55,073
Wukong laughed. "Relax, Laozi.

62
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:57,422
I was just joking around.

63
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:59,015
I knew it was you.

64
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:00,955
Here's your gourd."

65
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:07,033
Wukong took the gourd out of his robe and handed it to the sage.

66
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:11,253
"Why did that demon have your gourd?" asked the monkey.

67
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:14,391
"Golden Horn works for me," said Laozi.

68
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:16,959
"I sent him here to cause trouble for you.

69
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,242
Buddha wanted to make sure you are all serious about reaching the Western Paradise.

70
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:24,661
You fought well, Wukong."

71
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:27,207
Wukong glanced at the gourd.

72
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,512
"Golden Horn is probably all liquid by now."

73
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:32,420
"No," said Laozi.

74
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:35,734
"The gourd won't harm him. Good-bye."

75
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:42,114
The sage vanished.

76
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:46,076
The group continued west.

77
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,546
As night fell they arrived at a monastery.

78
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:58,217
After a small dinner with the monastery's monks, everyone went to bed.

79
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:05,332
The Tang Monk was almost asleep when he heard a moaning sound from outside.

80
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,567
The monk sat up, trembling with fear.

81
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:11,658
Was a ghost approaching?

82
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:18,313
Slowly his door creaked open.

83
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:21,683
A man stood in the doorway, dripping wet.

84
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:26,863
He looked at the monk and held out his hands.

85
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:33,449
"Please help me!"
