1
00:00:11,000 --> 115:40:11,000
[g@Golden Horn scowled at Wukong.

2
115:41:51,000 --> 223:55:11,000
"I doubt you have a gourd like mine."@g]

3
223:56:51,000 --> 305:03:31,000
[g@"I do," said Wukong.

4
305:05:11,000 --> 377:58:31,000
He held up the real gourd.@g]

5
378:00:11,000 --> 457:35:11,000
The demon looked carefully at the gourd.

6
457:36:51,000 --> 554:28:31,000
[g@"That does look like my gourd.

7
554:30:11,000 --> 653:10:11,000
But my gourd is magical."@g]

8
653:11:51,000 --> 742:03:31,000
"My gourd is magical too," said Wukong.

9
742:05:11,000 --> 795:45:11,000
[g@The demon rubbed his chin.

10
795:46:51,000 --> 892:11:51,000
"What can your gourd do?"@g]

11
892:13:31,000 --> 975:10:11,000
"It can hold a demon," said Wukong.

12
975:11:51,000 --> 1049:56:51,000
"All I have to do is say the demon's name.

13
1049:58:31,000 --> 1154:35:11,000
The demon will get sucked in and then turn into liquid."

14
1154:36:51,000 --> 1228:58:31,000
[g@Golden Horn raised his eyebrows.

15
1229:00:11,000 --> 1323:51:51,000
"My gourd can do that too.@g]

16
1323:53:31,000 --> 1424:21:51,000
[g@Let's see whose gourd works better.

17
1424:23:31,000 --> 1523:40:11,000
I'll go first.

18
1523:41:51,000 --> 1640:06:51,000
Um, I forgot your name."@g]

19
1640:08:31,000 --> 1729:10:11,000
"Kong Sunwu," said Wukong.

20
1729:11:51,000 --> 1834:53:31,000
[g@"Oh yes. Now I remember."

21
1834:55:11,000 --> 1991:18:31,000
Golden Horn held up his gourd. "Kong Sunwu!"@g]

22
1991:20:11,000 --> 2071:21:51,000
Nothing happened.

23
2071:23:31,000 --> 2161:11:51,000
[g@Golden Horn looked at his gourd.

24
2161:13:31,000 --> 2272:13:31,000
"Why isn't my gourd working?"@g]

25
2272:15:11,000 --> 2457:10:11,000
"Let me try mine," said Wukong. "Golden Horn!"

26
2457:11:51,000 --> 2583:58:31,000
[i@Shloomp!@i] Instantly the demon was sucked into the gourd.

27
2584:00:11,000 --> 2646:18:31,000
[g@"Ha-ha!" Wukong laughed.

28
2646:20:11,000 --> 2753:33:31,000
"Golden Horn will soon be turned into liquid!"@g]

29
2753:35:11,000 --> 2867:36:51,000
He closed the gourd and ran into the cave.

30
2867:38:31,000 --> 3003:46:51,000
[g@Several demons were inside.

31
3003:48:31,000 --> 3085:28:31,000
The monkey waved his iron bar at them.@g]

32
3085:30:11,000 --> 3204:53:31,000
"Get out of here before I clobber you all!" he shouted.

33
3204:55:11,000 --> 3394:21:51,000
"Ahh!" The demons screamed and ran out of the cave.

34
3394:23:31,000 --> 3576:36:51,000
After a quick search of the cave, Wukong found his companions.

35
3576:38:31,000 --> 3688:45:11,000
"We thought you were trapped under mountains," said the Tang Monk.

36
3688:46:51,000 --> 3811:48:31,000
[g@"I was freed a couple of hours ago," said Wukong.

37
3811:50:11,000 --> 3875:06:51,000
He untied the monk.@g]

38
3875:08:31,000 --> 3969:11:51,000
"A couple of hours ago?" asked Bajie.

39
3969:13:31,000 --> 4046:56:51,000
[g@"What were you doing for all that time?

40
4046:58:31,000 --> 4156:06:51,000
We were scared to death in here!"@g]

41
4156:08:31,000 --> 4197:11:51,000
Wukong shrugged.

42
4197:13:31,000 --> 4253:28:31,000
[g@"I couldn't free you right away.

43
4253:30:11,000 --> 4381:51:51,000
I had to get rid of the demon first."@g]

44
4381:53:31,000 --> 4532:48:31,000
[g@The monkey untied Bajie and Wujing.

45
4532:50:11,000 --> 4627:46:51,000
They all went outside.@g]

46
4627:48:31,000 --> 4728:01:51,000
"It's still early in the afternoon," said Wujing.

47
4728:03:31,000 --> 4807:11:51,000
"Let's start walking now."

48
4807:13:31,000 --> 4872:05:11,000
"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

49
4872:06:51,000 --> 5046:56:51,000
"I want to be as far from this mountain as I can by nighttime."

50
5046:58:31,000 --> 5161:36:51,000
The travelers hurried west along the road.

51
5161:38:31,000 --> 5307:41:51,000
They hadn't gone far when an old man approached them.

52
5307:43:31,000 --> 5418:11:51,000
"Give me back my gourd!" said the old man.

53
5418:13:31,000 --> 5487:46:51,000
[g@Wukong stepped forward.

54
5487:48:31,000 --> 5568:11:51,000
"What gourd? I don't have a gourd."@g]

55
5568:13:31,000 --> 5678:08:31,000
"I know you have my gourd," said the man.

56
5678:10:11,000 --> 5782:23:31,000
"I don't know what you're talking about," said the monkey.

57
5782:25:11,000 --> 5855:05:11,000
There was a flash of light.

58
5855:06:51,000 --> 5961:43:31,000
[g@Then Laozi the sage stood before the travelers.

59
5961:45:11,000 --> 6016:03:31,000
He looked angry.@g]

60
6016:05:11,000 --> 6124:15:11,000
"Give me my gourd, Wukong!" boomed the sage.

61
6124:16:51,000 --> 6224:15:11,000
[g@Wukong laughed. "Relax, Laozi.

62
6224:16:51,000 --> 6289:30:11,000
I was just joking around.@g]

63
6289:31:51,000 --> 6333:45:11,000
[g@I knew it was you.

64
6333:46:51,000 --> 6387:38:31,000
Here's your gourd."@g]

65
6387:40:11,000 --> 6556:28:31,000
Wukong took the gourd out of his robe and handed it to the sage.

66
6556:30:11,000 --> 6673:41:51,000
"Why did that demon have your gourd?" asked the monkey.

67
6673:43:31,000 --> 6760:51:51,000
"Golden Horn works for me," said Laozi.

68
6760:53:31,000 --> 6832:11:51,000
"I sent him here to cause trouble for you.

69
6832:13:31,000 --> 6978:56:51,000
Buddha wanted to make sure you are all serious [n@about reaching the Western Paradise.

70
6978:58:31,000 --> 7046:08:31,000
You fought well, Wukong."

71
7046:10:11,000 --> 7116:51:51,000
[g@Wukong glanced at the gourd.

72
7116:53:31,000 --> 7208:40:11,000
"Golden Horn is probably all liquid by now."@g]

73
7208:41:51,000 --> 7261:40:11,000
[g@"No," said Laozi.

74
7261:41:51,000 --> 7353:43:31,000
"The gourd won't harm him. Good-bye."@g]

75
7353:45:11,000 --> 7530:56:51,000
The sage vanished.

76
7530:58:31,000 --> 7641:00:11,000
[g@The group continued west.

77
7641:01:51,000 --> 7737:23:31,000
As night fell they arrived at a monastery.@g]

78
7737:25:11,000 --> 7978:15:11,000
After a small dinner with the monastery's monks, everyone went to bed.

79
7978:16:51,000 --> 8175:53:31,000
The Tang Monk was almost asleep when [n@he heard a moaning sound from outside.

80
8175:55:11,000 --> 8265:45:11,000
[g@The monk sat up, trembling with fear.

81
8265:46:51,000 --> 8351:36:51,000
Was a ghost approaching?@g]

82
8351:38:31,000 --> 8536:28:31,000
[g@Slowly his door creaked open.

83
8536:30:11,000 --> 8630:05:11,000
A man stood in the doorway, dripping wet.@g]

84
8630:06:51,000 --> 8773:58:31,000
[g@He looked at the monk and held out his hands.

85
8774:00:11,000 --> 8956:55:11,000
"Please help me!"@g]
