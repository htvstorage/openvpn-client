1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:15,152
The Tang Monk was tied up in a room.

2
00:00:15,153 --> 00:00:18,831
He heard his companions yelling at the monster.

3
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:23,929
"Hand over the Tang Monk now!" shouted Bajie.

4
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,767
[i@Clang!@i] The Tang Monk heard the sound of weapons clashing.

5
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,339
"I hope they rescue me," said the monk.

6
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,788
A young woman entered the room.

7
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:40,206
"Wh-who are you?" asked the Tang Monk.

8
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,237
"I'm a prisoner here," said the woman.

9
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:48,468
"That monster kidnapped me 13 years ago and won't let me leave.

10
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,468
Will you help me?"

11
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:54,326
"I wish I could help you," said the Tang Monk.

12
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:57,458
He showed the young woman his ropes.

13
00:00:57,459 --> 00:01:00,814
"I can help you get free," said the young woman.

14
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:05,125
"If I do, will you deliver a letter to my parents?"

15
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:09,670
"Of course," said the monk. "Who are your parents?"

16
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:15,248
"They're the king and queen of the Precious [n@Image Kingdom," said the young woman.

17
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:21,870
"My name is Princess Hundred Flowers."

18
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:30,469
Bajie and Wujing were still fighting the monster [n@when the princess ran outside.

19
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:36,038
"Monster!" she cried. "I must ask you a favor."

20
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:40,658
Right away the monster stopped fighting and turned to the princess.

21
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:45,693
"What can I do for you, my sweet?" asked the monster.

22
00:01:45,694 --> 00:01:49,011
"There's a monk inside," said the princess.

23
00:01:49,012 --> 00:01:52,452
[g@"It makes me so sad to see him tied up.

24
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:54,657
Won't you let him go?"@g]

25
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:57,924
[g@The monster hesitated.

26
00:01:57,925 --> 00:02:03,609
"That monk isn't an ordinary monk. He's the—"@g]

27
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,159
Princess Hundred Flowers pretended to cry.

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,626
[g@The monster held up his hands.

29
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:12,047
"Okay, okay, sweetie.@g]

30
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:15,564
[g@You know I only want you to be happy.

31
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:18,282
The monk may go."@g]

32
00:02:18,283 --> 00:02:21,927
The monster followed the princess back inside.

33
00:02:21,928 --> 00:02:26,124
Bajie and Wujing looked at each other in confusion.

34
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:31,422
"The monster is going to free him?" mumbled Bajie.

35
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:36,927
A moment later the Tang Monk came out.

36
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,104
"There's something we must do," he said quietly to his companions.

37
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:48,878
Later that day the travelers reached the [n@palace of the Precious Image Kingdom.

38
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,094
[g@The queen was reading the letter from her daughter.

39
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:54,491
Tears were in her eyes.@g]

40
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:57,840
[g@"Our poor daughter," said the queen.

41
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:01,527
"She's been a prisoner all this time."@g]

42
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:06,631
The king stood up, his eyes blazing with anger.

43
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:10,580
He called to his general, who was standing nearby.

44
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:13,053
"Gather your troops," said the king.

45
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:15,062
[g@"I want my daughter back.

46
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:19,521
And I want that monster destroyed!"@g]

47
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:22,410
"Forgive me, Your Majesty," said the general.

48
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,343
[g@"But we are just men.

49
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:28,393
How can we defeat such a powerful monster?"@g]

50
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:31,465
"My two companions are powerful spirits, Your Majesty."

51
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:33,886
[g@The Tang Monk spoke up.

52
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:39,710
"I'm sure they can rescue your daughter."@g]

53
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:44,593
Soon Bajie and Wujing were back at the pagoda.

54
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:47,398
[g@The pig swung his rake.

55
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:51,067
[i@Crash!@i] The door exploded.@g]

56
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:54,905
"Get out here, you rotten monster!" he shouted.

57
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,333
[g@The monster ran outside.

58
00:03:57,334 --> 00:04:00,427
"You brutes!" he yelled.@g]

59
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:03,090
[g@"I let the monk go free.

60
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:06,758
Why did you smash my door down?"@g]

61
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,173
"We're here for the princess," said Wujing.

62
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:13,932
"The king of the Precious Image Kingdom sent us."

63
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:18,608
[g@"You can't take the princess away," said the monster.

64
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:21,208
"We are in love."@g]

65
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,862
[g@Bajie and Wujing attacked.

66
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,604
The monster blocked their weapons.@g]

67
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:31,608
They fought for over an hour.

68
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:36,030
Finally Bajie, tired from fighting, turned and ran.

69
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:39,116
[g@Wujing was furious.

70
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:44,087
"Bajie!" he shouted. "Where are you—oof!"@g]

71
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:49,865
The monster knocked out Wujing and tied him up.

72
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:55,899
He dragged Wujing into the pagoda and locked him in a room.

73
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,747
"The king knows that the princess is here," said the monster to himself.

74
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:06,719
"But how?" He tapped his chin and thought.

75
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,070
"Aha!" he said.

76
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:13,819
"The princess must have asked that monk to go to the king."

77
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,775
[g@His eyes became dark and angry.

78
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:23,314
"She tricked me!"@g]
