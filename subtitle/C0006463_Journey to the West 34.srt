00:00:11,266.66699999999946 --> 107:55:11,266.66699999570847
The Tang Monk was tied up in a room.

2
107:56:51,266.66699999570847 --> 210:06:51,266.6670000553131
He heard his companions yelling at the monster.

3
210:08:31,266.6670000553131 --> 351:43:31,266.6670000553131
"Hand over the Tang Monk now!" shouted Bajie.

4
351:45:11,266.6670000553131 --> 486:06:51,266.6670000553131
[i@Clang!@i] The Tang Monk heard the sound of weapons clashing.

5
486:08:31,266.6670000553131 --> 613:06:51,266.66699981689453
"I hope they rescue me," said the monk.

6
613:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 708:55:11,266.66699981689453
A young woman entered the room.

7
708:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 803:51:51,266.66699981689453
"Wh-who are you?" asked the Tang Monk.

8
803:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 888:03:31,266.66699981689453
"I'm a prisoner here," said the woman.

9
888:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1033:21:51,266.66699981689453
"That monster kidnapped me 13 years ago and won't let me leave.

10
1033:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1088:55:11,266.66699981689453
Will you help me?"

11
1088:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1196:05:11,266.66699981689453
"I wish I could help you," said the Tang Monk.

12
1196:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1283:05:11,266.66699981689453
He showed the young woman his ropes.

13
1283:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1376:18:31,266.66699981689453
"I can help you get free," said the young woman.

14
1376:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1496:03:31,266.66699981689453
"If I do, will you deliver a letter to my parents?"

15
1496:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1622:18:31,266.66699981689453
"Of course," said the monk. "Who are your parents?"

16
1622:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1777:15:11,266.66699981689453
"They're the king and queen of the Precious [n@Image Kingdom," said the young woman.

17
1777:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1961:11:51,266.66699981689453
"My name is Princess Hundred Flowers."

18
1961:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2200:03:31,266.66699981689453
Bajie and Wujing were still fighting the monster [n@when the princess ran outside.

19
2200:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2354:45:11,266.66699981689453
"Monster!" she cried. "I must ask you a favor."

20
2354:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2483:05:11,266.66699981689453
Right away the monster stopped fighting and turned to the princess.

21
2483:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2622:56:51,266.66699981689453
"What can I do for you, my sweet?" asked the monster.

22
2622:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2715:06:51,266.66699981689453
"There's a monk inside," said the princess.

23
2715:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2810:41:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"It makes me so sad to see him tied up.

24
2810:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2871:56:51,266.66699981689453
Won't you let him go?"@g]

25
2871:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2962:41:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The monster hesitated.

26
2962:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3120:36:51,266.66699981689453
"That monk isn't an ordinary monk. He's the—"@g]

27
3120:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3219:13:31,266.66699981689453
Princess Hundred Flowers pretended to cry.

28
3219:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3287:45:11,266.66699981689453
[g@The monster held up his hands.

29
3287:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3355:00:11,266.66699981689453
"Okay, okay, sweetie.@g]

30
3355:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3452:41:51,266.66699981689453
[g@You know I only want you to be happy.

31
3452:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3528:11:51,266.66699981689453
The monk may go."@g]

32
3528:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3629:26:51,266.66699981689453
The monster followed the princess back inside.

33
3629:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3746:01:51,266.66699981689453
Bajie and Wujing looked at each other in confusion.

34
3746:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3893:11:51,266.66699981689453
"The monster is going to free him?" mumbled Bajie.

35
3893:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4046:06:51,266.66699981689453
A moment later the Tang Monk came out.

36
4046:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4217:41:51,266.66699981689453
"There's something we must do," he said quietly to his companions.

37
4217:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4378:05:11,266.66699981689453
Later that day the travelers reached the [n@palace of the Precious Image Kingdom.

38
4378:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4467:25:11,266.66699981689453
[g@The queen was reading the letter from her daughter.

39
4467:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4534:00:11,266.66699981689453
Tears were in her eyes.@g]

40
4534:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4627:01:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"Our poor daughter," said the queen.

41
4627:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4729:26:51,266.66699981689453
"She's been a prisoner all this time."@g]

42
4729:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4871:13:31,266.66699981689453
The king stood up, his eyes blazing with anger.

43
4871:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4980:55:11,266.66699981689453
He called to his general, who was standing nearby.

44
4980:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5049:36:51,266.66699981689453
"Gather your troops," said the king.

45
5049:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5105:25:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"I want my daughter back.

And I want that monster destroyed!"@g]

47
5229:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5309:31:51,266.66699981689453
"Forgive me, Your Majesty," said the general.

48
5309:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5363:13:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"But we are just men.

5363:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5475:43:31,266.66699981689453
How can we defeat such a powerful monster?"@g]

50
5475:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5561:03:31,266.66699981689453
"My two companions are powerful spirits, Your Majesty."

51
5561:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5628:18:31,266.66699981689453
[g@The Tang Monk spoke up.

52
5628:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5790:05:11,266.66699981689453
"I'm sure they can rescue your daughter."@g]

5790:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5925:43:31,266.66699981689453
Soon Bajie and Wujing were back at the pagoda.

54
5925:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6003:38:31,266.66699981689453
[g@The pig swung his rake.

6003:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6105:33:31,266.66699981689453
[i@Crash!@i] The door exploded.@g]

6105:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6212:10:11,266.66699981689453
"Get out here, you rotten monster!" he shouted.

57
6212:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6279:36:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The monster ran outside.

58
6279:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6365:33:31,266.66699981689453
"You brutes!" he yelled.@g]

59
6365:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6439:31:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"I let the monk go free.

6439:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6541:25:11,266.66699981689453
Why did you smash my door down?"@g]

61
6541:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6636:16:51,266.66699981689453
"We're here for the princess," said Wujing.

62
6636:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6740:41:51,266.66699981689453
"The king of the Precious Image Kingdom sent us."

63
6740:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6870:35:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"You can't take the princess away," said the monster.

64
6870:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6942:48:31,266.66699981689453
"We are in love."@g]

65
6942:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7016:31:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Bajie and Wujing attacked.

66
7016:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7092:41:51,266.66699981689453
The monster blocked their weapons.@g]

67
7092:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7231:41:51,266.66699981689453
They fought for over an hour.

68
7231:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7354:31:51,266.66699981689453
Finally Bajie, tired from fighting, turned and ran.

69
7354:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7440:15:11,266.66699981689453
[g@Wujing was furious.

70
7440:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7578:20:11,266.66699981689453
"Bajie!" he shouted. "Where are you—oof!"@g]

7578:21:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7738:50:11,266.66699981689453
The monster knocked out Wujing and tied him up.

72
7738:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7906:26:51,266.66699981689453
He dragged Wujing into the pagoda and locked him in a room.

73
7906:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8068:53:31,266.66699981689453
"The king knows that the princess is here," said the monster to himself.

74
8068:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8207:00:11,266.66699981689453
"But how?" He tapped his chin and thought.

75
8207:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 8272:18:31,266.66699981689453
"Aha!" he said.

8272:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8404:13:31,266.66699981689453
"The princess must have asked that monk to go to the king."
