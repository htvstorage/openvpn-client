00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 186:55:10,933.3329999446869
Wukong returned from the Land of Darkness.

2
186:56:50,933.3329999446869 --> 296:36:50,933.3329999446869
Lady Kou brought the travelers back to her house.

3
296:38:30,933.3329999446869 --> 422:58:30,933.3329999446869
Inside the coffin the squire's body was gray and lifeless.

4
423:00:10,933.3329999446869 --> 533:33:30,933.3329999446869
Wukong leaned over the coffin and recited a spell.

5
533:35:10,933.3329999446869 --> 733:30:10,933.3330001831055
Lady Kou gasped as color returned to her husband's face.

6
733:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 804:48:30,933.3330001831055
"It's working!" said Wujing.

7
804:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 903:35:10,933.3330001831055
"The squire is coming back to life!" said the Tang Monk.

8
903:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 965:35:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie licked his lips.

9
965:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1086:00:10,933.3330001831055
"Maybe the squire will thank us with a big feast."@g]

10
1086:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1167:40:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Squire Kou sat up and smiled.

11
1167:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1248:51:50,933.3330001831055
"Thank you, Wukong."@g]

12
1248:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1356:20:10,933.3330001831055
He climbed out of the coffin and turned to his wife.

13
1356:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1411:11:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Tears filled her eyes.

14
1411:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1560:20:10,933.3330001831055
The two embraced.@g]

15
1560:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1702:16:50,933.3330001831055
That night Squire and Lady Kou held a feast to thank Wukong.

16
1702:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1866:41:50,933.3330001831055
And the next morning they let the travelers leave without any argument.

17
1866:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2014:40:10,933.3330001831055
"Good luck!" called Lady Kou as they departed.

18
2014:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2135:18:30,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk and his companions traveled for many more months.

19
2135:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2354:48:30,933.3330001831055
Through rain and snow, heat and cold, they slowly continued west.

20
2354:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2494:38:30,933.3330001831055
One day the road went into a beautiful land.

21
2494:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2601:26:50,933.3330001831055
There were flowers and magnificent trees.

22
2601:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2714:10:10,933.3330001831055
People smiled at the travelers and offered food.

23
2714:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2796:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk stared in amazement.

24
2796:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2869:26:50,933.3330001831055
"What is this place?"@g]

25
2869:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2965:01:50,933.3330001831055
"We are in the West," said Wukong.

26
2965:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3060:15:10,933.3330001831055
"We are very close to the Western Paradise."

27
3060:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3159:00:10,933.3330001831055
A woman held out a basket of plums.

28
3159:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3239:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie scooped up a handful.

29
3239:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3317:33:30,933.3330001831055
"I love this place."@g]

30
3317:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3349:45:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Look up ahead,"

31
3349:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3445:56:50,933.3330001831055
said Wujing, pointing to a row of tall buildings.@g]

32
3445:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3490:23:30,933.3330001831055
"It's an abbey."

33
3490:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3656:35:10,933.3330001831055
The road led through a large gate in the abbey.

34
3656:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3776:03:30,933.3330001831055
[g@At the gate the monk got down from his horse.

35
3776:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3880:33:30,933.3330001831055
A young man greeted them.@g]

36
3880:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3967:18:30,933.3330001831055
"Are you the Tang Monk?" asked the man.

37
3967:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4022:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Yes," said the monk.

38
4022:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4092:16:50,933.3330001831055
He waved toward the rest of the group.@g]

39
4092:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4164:51:50,933.3330001831055
"And these are my companions."

40
4164:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4219:16:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"You've finally arrived!"

41
4219:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4291:25:10,933.3330001831055
The man laughed.@g]

42
4291:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4397:46:50,933.3330001831055
"I was starting to think that the bodhisattva Guanyin had tricked me.

43
4397:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4480:25:10,933.3330001831055
She told me you would arrive in a year or so.

44
4480:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4556:16:50,933.3330001831055
But that was over ten years ago!"

45
4556:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4602:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk bowed.

46
4602:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4700:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Forgive me. I wanted to arrive much sooner.@g]

47
4700:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4819:03:30,933.3330001831055
But we faced many dangers and delays along the way."

48
4819:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4880:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie snorted.

49
4880:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4991:38:30,933.3330001831055
"And this place wasn't very easy to find either."@g]

50
4991:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5032:50:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The man smiled.

51
5032:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5109:33:30,933.3330001831055
"There is no need to apologize.@g]

52
5109:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5238:03:30,933.3330001831055
I'm the Great Immortal of the Golden Head, and this abbey is my home.

53
5238:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5325:20:10,933.3330001831055
Beyond it lies the Western Paradise.

54
5325:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5518:25:10,933.3330001831055
Come inside and rest before you continue."

55
5518:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5712:26:50,933.3330001831055
Servants filled tubs with warm, perfumed water, and the travelers took baths.

56
5712:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5822:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"It feels good to get clean," said Bajie.

57
5822:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5911:00:10,933.3330001831055
"I haven't had a bath in months."@g]

58
5911:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5960:28:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong laughed.

59
5960:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6065:56:50,933.3330001831055
"Now we won't have to cover our noses when you're near!"@g]

60
6065:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6172:15:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie snorted and splashed water at Wukong.

61
6172:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6239:21:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The monkey splashed back.

62
6239:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6346:41:50,933.3330001831055
Everyone laughed.@g]

63
6346:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6498:48:30,933.3330001831055
After their baths the Tang Monk put on the Buddhist [n@robe Guanyuin had given him.

64
6498:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6625:35:10,933.3330001831055
Then the travelers enjoyed a large meal with the immortal.

65
6625:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6918:10:10,933.3330001831055
Servants brought trays loaded with noodles, [n@vegetables, tofu, and steamed buns.

66
6918:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7073:40:10,933.3330001831055
In the morning the immortal led the group out the back door of the abbey.

67
7073:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7230:25:10,933.3330001831055
The road continued west, through a land even more beautiful and magical.

68
7230:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7403:41:50,933.3330001831055
Birds sang as animals leaped playfully through the flowers.

69
7403:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7531:35:10,933.3330001831055
Brilliant light sparkled on everything.

70
7531:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7612:58:30,933.3330001831055
[g@In the distance stood a huge mountain.

71
7613:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7698:33:30,933.3330001831055
Its peak was hidden by clouds.@g]

72
7698:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7798:45:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk stared silently at the mountain.

73
7798:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7888:23:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong put his hand on the monk's shoulder.

74
7888:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7969:53:30,933.3330001831055
"That's the Spirit Mountain, Master.

75
7969:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8048:43:30,933.3330001831055
We're almost at the end of our journey."

76
8048:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8144:16:50,933.3330001831055
A smile spread across the monk's face.

77
8144:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8224:43:30,933.3330001831055
The travelers thanked the immortal.

78
8224:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8335:01:50,933.3330001831055
Filled with energy now, they hurried down the road.

79
8335:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8540:03:30,933.3330001831055
The steep slopes of the Spirit Mountain towered over them.
