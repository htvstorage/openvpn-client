1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:17,662
Wukong returned from the Land of Darkness.

2
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:21,611
Lady Kou brought the travelers back to her house.

3
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:26,160
Inside the coffin the squire's body was gray and lifeless.

4
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:30,141
Wukong leaned over the coffin and recited a spell.

5
00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:37,339
Lady Kou gasped as color returned to her husband's face.

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,906
"It's working!" said Wujing.

7
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:43,462
"The squire is coming back to life!" said the Tang Monk.

8
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:45,694
Bajie licked his lips.

9
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:50,029
"Maybe the squire will thank us with a big feast."

10
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,969
Squire Kou sat up and smiled.

11
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,892
"Thank you, Wukong."

12
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:59,761
He climbed out of the coffin and turned to his wife.

13
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:01,736
Tears filled her eyes.

14
00:01:01,737 --> 00:01:07,105
The two embraced.

15
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:12,215
That night Squire and Lady Kou held a feast to thank Wukong.

16
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:18,134
And the next morning they let the travelers leave without any argument.

17
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:23,461
"Good luck!" called Lady Kou as they departed.

18
00:01:23,462 --> 00:01:27,804
The Tang Monk and his companions traveled for many more months.

19
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:35,706
Through rain and snow, heat and cold, they slowly continued west.

20
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:40,740
One day the road went into a beautiful land.

21
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:44,585
There were flowers and magnificent trees.

22
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:48,643
People smiled at the travelers and offered food.

23
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:51,618
The Tang Monk stared in amazement.

24
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:54,233
"What is this place?"

25
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:57,674
"We are in the West," said Wukong.

26
00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:01,102
"We are very close to the Western Paradise."

27
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:04,657
A woman held out a basket of plums.

28
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,549
Bajie scooped up a handful.

29
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,365
"I love this place."

30
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:11,524
"Look up ahead,"

31
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:14,987
said Wujing, pointing to a row of tall buildings.

32
00:02:14,988 --> 00:02:16,587
"It's an abbey."

33
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:22,570
The road led through a large gate in the abbey.

34
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:26,871
At the gate the monk got down from his horse.

35
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:30,633
A young man greeted them.

36
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:33,756
"Are you the Tang Monk?" asked the man.

37
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:35,750
"Yes," said the monk.

38
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:38,255
He waved toward the rest of the group.

39
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:40,868
"And these are my companions."

40
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,827
"You've finally arrived!"

41
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:45,424
The man laughed.

42
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:49,253
"I was starting to think that the bodhisattva Guanyin had tricked me.

43
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:52,228
She told me you would arrive in a year or so.

44
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:54,959
But that was over ten years ago!"

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,617
The Tang Monk bowed.

46
00:02:56,618 --> 00:03:00,147
"Forgive me. I wanted to arrive much sooner.

47
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:04,419
But we faced many dangers and delays along the way."

48
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,638
Bajie snorted.

49
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,632
"And this place wasn't very easy to find either."

50
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:12,115
The man smiled.

51
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:14,877
"There is no need to apologize.

52
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,503
I'm the Great Immortal of the Golden Head, and this abbey is my home.

53
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:22,645
Beyond it lies the Western Paradise.

54
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:29,596
Come inside and rest before you continue."

55
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:36,581
Servants filled tubs with warm, perfumed water, and the travelers took baths.

56
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:40,529
"It feels good to get clean," said Bajie.

57
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,729
"I haven't had a bath in months."

58
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,510
Wukong laughed.

59
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:49,307
"Now we won't have to cover our noses when you're near!"

60
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:53,134
Bajie snorted and splashed water at Wukong.

61
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:55,550
The monkey splashed back.

62
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:59,414
Everyone laughed.

63
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:04,890
After their baths the Tang Monk put on the Buddhist robe Guanyuin had given him.

64
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:09,454
Then the travelers enjoyed a large meal with the immortal.

65
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:19,987
Servants brought trays loaded with noodles, vegetables, tofu, and steamed buns.

66
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:25,585
In the morning the immortal led the group out the back door of the abbey.

67
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:31,228
The road continued west, through a land even more beautiful and magical.

68
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:37,466
Birds sang as animals leaped playfully through the flowers.

69
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:42,070
Brilliant light sparkled on everything.

70
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:45,000
In the distance stood a huge mountain.

71
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:48,081
Its peak was hidden by clouds.

72
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:51,688
The Tang Monk stared silently at the mountain.

73
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:54,915
Wukong put his hand on the monk's shoulder.

74
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,849
"That's the Spirit Mountain, Master.

75
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,687
We're almost at the end of our journey."

76
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:04,127
A smile spread across the monk's face.

77
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:07,023
The travelers thanked the immortal.

78
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:10,994
Filled with energy now, they hurried down the road.

79
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:18,375
The steep slopes of the Spirit Mountain towered over them.
