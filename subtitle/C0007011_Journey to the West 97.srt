00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 248:53:30,933.3329999446869
Bajie took a step back as a dark mist surrounded the people on the road.

2
248:55:10,933.3329999446869 --> 437:26:50,933.3329999446869
When the mist cleared, he saw they were really [n@a monster and several little demons.

3
437:28:30,933.3329999446869 --> 502:46:50,933.3329999446869
The monster grinned at him.

4
502:48:30,933.3329999446869 --> 623:30:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Yes, you [i@are@i] here for the feast, Pig.

5
623:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 741:03:30,933.3330001831055
We're going to eat you for lunch!"@g]

741:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 938:51:50,933.3330001831055
"What?" Bajie raised his rake and swung as the monster approached.

7
938:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1051:11:50,933.3330001831055
The demons rushed toward the pig from all sides.

8
1051:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1174:53:30,933.3330001831055
"That rotten monkey lied to me!" cried Bajie.

9
1174:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1285:16:50,933.3330001831055
He spun around and knocked over two demons with his rake.

10
1285:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1343:43:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The monster threw a punch.

11
1343:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1420:10:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie blocked the punch with his rake.@g]

1420:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1552:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Ow!" cried the monster, rubbing his hand.

13
1552:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1661:10:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie kicked a demon sneaking up behind him.

14
1661:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1798:00:10,933.3330001831055
"That monkey is always causing problems!" the pig muttered.

15
1798:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1898:43:30,933.3330001831055
He slammed the rake down on another demon.

16
1898:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1955:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"So what if I like to eat?

17
1955:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2036:33:30,933.3330001831055
Did he really have to trick me?"@g]

18
2036:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2087:36:50,933.3330001831055
The monster attacked again.

19
2087:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2236:46:50,933.3330001831055
Bajie thrust his rake toward him, still complaining about Wukong.

20
2236:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2364:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Wukong is small—he doesn't need to eat as much as I do!"

21
2364:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2510:43:30,933.3330001831055
The monster suddenly stopped fighting and looked at Bajie curiously.

22
2510:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2603:13:30,933.3330001831055
"You just said 'Wukong.'

23
2603:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2830:53:30,933.3330001831055
Are you talking about Sun Wukong, the monkey who defeated [n@Heaven's entire army five hundred years ago?"

24
2830:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2965:01:50,933.3330001831055
"Um, yes," said Bajie. "Do you know him?"

25
2965:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3096:36:50,933.3330001831055
"I've heard he's traveling with the Tang Monk," said the monster.

26
3096:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3222:55:10,933.3330001831055
"You must be traveling with the Tang Monk too."

27
3222:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3356:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Why are you interested in the monk?" asked Bajie suspiciously.

28
3356:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3425:53:30,933.3330001831055
The monster licked his lips.

29
3425:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3584:16:50,933.3330001831055
"I've heard that anyone who eats the Tang Monk will live forever."

30
3584:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3738:20:10,933.3330001831055
Panicked, Bajie ran from the demons and back to his companions.

31
3738:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3782:20:10,933.3330001831055

3782:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3837:51:50,933.3330001831055

3837:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3912:23:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The monkey was laughing.

3912:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3987:55:10,933.3330001831055
"How was the feast, Bajie?"@g]

35
3987:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4113:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Grr!" Bajie's eyes burned with fury.

36
4113:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4186:10:10,933.3330001831055
He turned to the Tang Monk.@g]

4186:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4263:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Wukong told me there was a feast up ahead.

[g@But instead it was a group of demons and a monster.

4349:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4415:50:10,933.3330001831055

4415:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4502:03:30,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk was angry.

41
4502:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4600:15:10,933.3330001831055
"Bajie, I thought you were going to check the mountain!

4600:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4681:21:50,933.3330001831055

4860:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4977:06:50,933.3330001831055

4977:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5067:35:10,933.3330001831055
"And you, Wukong," snapped the Tang Monk.

5067:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5161:25:10,933.3330001831055

5247:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5310:05:10,933.3330001831055

"Please don't do that!"

5373:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5477:38:30,933.3330001831055
"You knew there were demons and a monster ahead," said the monk.

5477:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5551:11:50,933.3330001831055

"I admit I knew about the demons and the monster," said Wukong.

6519:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6671:51:50,933.3330001831055
"We must capture the Tang Monk," the monster said to the demons.
