1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:19,893
Bajie took a step back as a dark mist surrounded the people on the road.

2
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:26,681
When the mist cleared, he saw they were really a monster and several little demons.

3
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:29,033
The monster grinned at him.

4
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:33,379
"Yes, you are here for the feast, Pig.

5
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,611
We're going to eat you for lunch!"

6
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:44,732
"What?" Bajie raised his rake and swung as the monster approached.

7
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:48,776
The demons rushed toward the pig from all sides.

8
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:53,229
"That rotten monkey lied to me!" cried Bajie.

9
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,203
He spun around and knocked over two demons with his rake.

10
00:00:57,204 --> 00:00:59,307
The monster threw a punch.

11
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:02,059
Bajie blocked the punch with his rake.

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,833
"Ow!" cried the monster, rubbing his hand.

13
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:10,735
Bajie kicked a demon sneaking up behind him.

14
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:15,661
"That monkey is always causing problems!" the pig muttered.

15
00:01:15,662 --> 00:01:19,287
He slammed the rake down on another demon.

16
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,341
"So what if I like to eat?

17
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:24,249
Did he really have to trick me?"

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,087
The monster attacked again.

19
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:31,457
Bajie thrust his rake toward him, still complaining about Wukong.

20
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:36,069
"Wukong is small—he doesn't need to eat as much as I do!"

21
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,319
The monster suddenly stopped fighting and looked at Bajie curiously.

22
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,649
"You just said 'Wukong.'

23
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:52,845
Are you talking about Sun Wukong, the monkey who defeated Heaven's entire army five hundred years ago?"

24
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:57,674
"Um, yes," said Bajie. "Do you know him?"

25
00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:02,411
"I've heard he's traveling with the Tang Monk," said the monster.

26
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:06,958
"You must be traveling with the Tang Monk too."

27
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,767
"Why are you interested in the monk?" asked Bajie suspiciously.

28
00:02:11,768 --> 00:02:14,265
The monster licked his lips.

29
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:19,967
"I've heard that anyone who eats the Tang Monk will live forever."

30
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:25,513
Panicked, Bajie ran from the demons and back to his companions.

31
00:02:25,514 --> 00:02:27,097
He pointed at Wukong.

32
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:29,096
"You tricked me!"

33
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:31,779
The monkey was laughing.

34
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,498
"How was the feast, Bajie?"

35
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:39,034
"Grr!" Bajie's eyes burned with fury.

36
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:41,635
He turned to the Tang Monk.

37
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:44,429
"Wukong told me there was a feast up ahead.

38
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,503
But instead it was a group of demons and a monster.

39
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:49,903
They tried to eat me!"

40
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:53,007
The Tang Monk was angry.

41
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:56,542
"Bajie, I thought you were going to check the mountain!

42
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,462
Instead you went to look for a feast?

43
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:01,068
You lied to me.

44
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:03,611
You should be ashamed of yourself!"

45
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:05,906
Bajie hung his head.

46
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:10,109
By now Wukong was rolling on the ground, laughing.

47
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,366
"And you, Wukong," snapped the Tang Monk.

48
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,744
"I should recite the Tight Headband spell to punish you!"

49
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:19,852
Instantly the monkey stopped laughing.

50
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:22,096
He jumped to his feet.

51
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:24,375
"Please don't do that!"

52
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:28,128
"You knew there were demons and a monster ahead," said the monk.

53
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:30,776
"And you didn't say anything?"

54
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,436
Wujing shook his head.

55
00:03:32,437 --> 00:03:35,693
"You should have said something, Wukong."

56
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:40,999
"I admit I knew about the demons and the monster," said Wukong.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,810
"But they're not dangerous."

58
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:46,851
"Not dangerous?" Bajie scoffed.

59
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,833
"They wanted to eat me!

60
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:51,792
And now they're planning to eat Master!"

61
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:54,674
"Oh no!" cried the Tang Monk.

62
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:57,105
Wukong held up his hands.

63
00:03:57,106 --> 00:04:05,631
"Relax, Master. You have nothing to worry about."

64
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:11,120
"We must capture the Tang Monk," the monster said to the demons.

65
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:13,101
"But we need a plan.

66
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:15,812
Sun Wukong is strong.

67
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:20,672
Did you know that he once defeated Heaven's entire army?"

68
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:24,696
"Yes, we've heard," said one of the demons.

69
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,001
Another demon hurried over.

70
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:29,881
"I just spied on the travelers.

71
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:39,251
The Tang Monk has three spirit companions—Sun Wukong, that pig, and a purple fellow."

72
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:43,611
"Hmm," said the monster. "That's bad."

73
00:04:43,612 --> 00:04:46,709
"Not really," said the demon.

74
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,989
"I have a plan to lure the spirits away from the monk."

75
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,722
The demon told the monster his plan.

76
00:04:53,723 --> 00:04:57,572
When he was done speaking, the demon folded his arms.

77
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,791
"What do you think?"

78
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:03,718
A big smile spread across the monster's face.

79
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:12,729
"I love it!"
