325:48:30,933.3329999446869 --> 433:03:30,933.3329999446869

433:05:10,933.3329999446869 --> 546:26:50,933.3329999446869
The lion pounced.

546:28:30,933.3329999446869 --> 707:20:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong shot out of the cave as fast as he could.

7
707:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 918:36:50,933.3330001831055
He didn't stop running until he was far from the cave.

8
918:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 999:20:10,933.3330001831055
"Whew," the monkey said to himself.

1043:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1133:38:30,933.3330001831055
I guess when I laughed I broke my concentration.@g]

11
1133:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1224:23:30,933.3330001831055
That must have made my disguise vanish."

1224:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1382:48:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong returned to his companions.

1382:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1521:28:30,933.3330001831055
"Well?" said Wujing. "Is there an army up ahead?"

14
1521:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1640:41:50,933.3330001831055
"I scared away the entire army," Wukong boasted.

15
1640:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1738:50:10,933.3330001831055
"But there are still three powerful demons on the mountain.

1738:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1862:01:50,933.3330001831055
They plan to capture Master and, well . . . eat him."

17
1862:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1970:40:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Oh!" cried the Tang Monk, nearly falling over.

18
1970:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2042:41:50,933.3330001831055
Wujing caught him.@g]

2042:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2135:16:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Don't worry, Master," said Wukong.

20
2135:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2200:18:30,933.3330001831055
"We won't let those demons harm you.@g]

2200:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2308:00:10,933.3330001831055
But we do have to destroy them before we cross the mountain.

22
2308:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2408:03:30,933.3330001831055
It's good that we discovered their plan before we went up the mountain."

23
2408:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2522:58:30,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk nodded, wringing his hands nervously.

24
2523:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2615:36:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong turned to Bajie and Wujing.

25
2615:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2718:50:10,933.3330001831055
"Someone needs to help me get rid of the demons."

2718:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2791:15:10,933.3330001831055
"I'll go with you," said Bajie.

2791:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2914:26:50,933.3330001831055
"I'll stay here and look after the Tang Monk," said Wujing.

2914:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3073:00:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong and Bajie went to the cave entrance.

3073:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3148:58:30,933.3330001831055

3149:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3224:16:50,933.3330001831055
Bajie raised his rake.@g]

"I'll do all the talking," said Wukong.

32
3315:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3404:01:50,933.3330001831055
"What are you going to say?" asked Bajie.

33
3404:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3514:38:30,933.3330001831055
"I'll just ask them nicely to leave," said Wukong.

34
3514:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3590:40:10,933.3330001831055
[g@He turned to the cave entrance.

"Leave this mountain now, or we'll knock it [n@down and crush all three of you!"

3917:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4006:05:10,933.3330001831055

4006:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4106:28:30,933.3330001831055
He towered over the monkey and the pig.

40
4106:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4253:10:10,933.3330001831055
"Why are you out here yelling?" asked the lion calmly.

41
4253:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4433:23:30,933.3330001831055
"You, the elephant, and the raptor must leave [n@this mountain at once," said Wukong.

4544:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4627:05:10,933.3330001831055
"We're not bothering you."@g]

"Villain!" shouted the monkey.

4695:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4790:50:10,933.3330001831055
"I know you're planning to capture and eat the Tang Monk!"

4790:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4930:00:10,933.3330001831055
"We haven't touched the Tang Monk," said the lion.

47
4930:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5102:50:10,933.3330001831055
"But you, Sun Wukong—you scared away our entire army.

5102:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5210:41:50,933.3330001831055
You're the villain here."

49
5210:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5305:26:50,933.3330001831055
"I'm not a villain!" shouted Wukong.

5305:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5463:43:30,933.3330001831055
He raised his iron bar and charged toward the lion.

51
5463:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5634:13:30,933.3330001831055
The lion opened his mouth wide, revealing huge, sharp fangs.

52
5634:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5745:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong swung his iron bar.

5745:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5869:40:10,933.3330001831055
The lion pounced and—[i@gulp!@i]@g]

5869:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5944:46:50,933.3330001831055
Bajie's face went white with horror.

55
5944:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6107:58:30,933.3330001831055
"Yikes!" he cried. "That lion just swallowed Wukong!"

56
6108:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6179:50:10,933.3330001831055
The pig ran as fast as he could.

57
6179:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6357:15:10,933.3330001831055
He didn't stop running until he reached Wujing and the Tang Monk.

58
6357:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6486:11:50,933.3330001831055
"What happened?" asked Wujing. "Where's Wukong?"

59
6486:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6667:36:50,933.3330001831055
"The journey . . . is . . . over," said the pig between breaths.

60
6667:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6777:03:30,933.3330001831055
"Wukong got . . . eaten!"

6777:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6859:00:10,933.3330001831055
"What!" cried the Tang Monk.

6859:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6910:40:10,933.3330001831055

7172:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7291:20:10,933.3330001831055

7376:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7467:35:10,933.3330001831055
"Did you scare away Sun Wukong?"

7467:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7574:38:30,933.3330001831055
"Not exactly," said the lion.

"You ate him?" asked the elephant.
