1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:15,329
[g@The elephant pointed at Wukong.

2
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,477
"He's not a demon. He's a monkey!"@g]

3
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,661
[g@"He's not just a monkey," said the raptor.

4
00:00:22,662 --> 00:00:26,523
"He's Sun Wukong. Get him!"@g]

5
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:30,605
The lion pounced.

6
00:00:30,606 --> 00:00:36,397
Wukong shot out of the cave as fast as he could.

7
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:44,003
He didn't stop running until he was far from the cave.

8
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:46,909
"Whew," the monkey said to himself.

9
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,490
[g@"That was close.

10
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:51,744
I guess when I laughed I broke my concentration.@g]

11
00:00:51,745 --> 00:00:55,011
That must have made my disguise vanish."

12
00:00:55,012 --> 00:01:00,714
Wukong returned to his companions.

13
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:05,706
"Well?" said Wujing. "Is there an army up ahead?"

14
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:09,998
"I scared away the entire army," Wukong boasted.

15
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:13,531
"But there are still three powerful demons on the mountain.

16
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:17,966
They plan to capture Master and, well . . . eat him."

17
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:21,877
[g@"Oh!" cried the Tang Monk, nearly falling over.

18
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:24,470
Wujing caught him.@g]

19
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:27,803
[g@"Don't worry, Master," said Wukong.

20
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:30,144
"We won't let those demons harm you.@g]

21
00:01:30,145 --> 00:01:34,021
But we do have to destroy them before we cross the mountain.

22
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:37,623
It's good that we discovered their plan before we went up the mountain."

23
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:41,760
The Tang Monk nodded, wringing his hands nervously.

24
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:45,095
Wukong turned to Bajie and Wujing.

25
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:48,811
"Someone needs to help me get rid of the demons."

26
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:51,418
"I'll go with you," said Bajie.

27
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:55,853
"I'll stay here and look after the Tang Monk," said Wujing.

28
00:01:55,854 --> 00:02:01,561
Wukong and Bajie went to the cave entrance.

29
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:04,296
[g@The monkey pulled out his iron bar.

30
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:07,007
Bajie raised his rake.@g]

31
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:10,284
"I'll do all the talking," said Wukong.

32
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:13,478
"What are you going to say?" asked Bajie.

33
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,460
"I'll just ask them nicely to leave," said Wukong.

34
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:20,197
[g@He turned to the cave entrance.

35
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:22,626
"Demons!" he shouted.@g]

36
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:27,955
"Leave this mountain now, or we'll knock it [n@down and crush all three of you!"

37
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:31,971
[g@For a moment everything was quiet.

38
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:35,152
Then the lion stepped out of the cave.@g]

39
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:38,766
He towered over the monkey and the pig.

40
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:44,047
"Why are you out here yelling?" asked the lion calmly.

41
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:50,535
"You, the elephant, and the raptor must leave [n@this mountain at once," said Wukong.

42
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:54,530
[g@"Why must we leave?" asked the lion.

43
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:57,508
"We're not bothering you."@g]

44
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,952
"Villain!" shouted the monkey.

45
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:03,403
"I know you're planning to capture and eat the Tang Monk!"

46
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:08,413
"We haven't touched the Tang Monk," said the lion.

47
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:14,635
"But you, Sun Wukong—you scared away our entire army.

48
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:18,518
You're the villain here."

49
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,929
"I'm not a villain!" shouted Wukong.

50
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,627
He raised his iron bar and charged toward the lion.

51
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:33,765
The lion opened his mouth wide, revealing huge, sharp fangs.

52
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:37,759
[g@Wukong swung his iron bar.

53
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,241
The lion pounced and—[i@gulp!@i]@g]

54
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:44,945
Bajie's face went white with horror.

55
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:50,820
"Yikes!" he cried. "That lion just swallowed Wukong!"

56
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:53,407
The pig ran as fast as he could.

57
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:59,794
He didn't stop running until he reached Wujing and the Tang Monk.

58
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:04,436
"What happened?" asked Wujing. "Where's Wukong?"

59
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:10,967
"The journey . . . is . . . over," said the pig between breaths.

60
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:14,907
"Wukong got . . . eaten!"

61
00:04:14,908 --> 00:04:17,857
"What!" cried the Tang Monk.

62
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,717
[g@Bajie shook his head.

63
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:23,608
"We should all just go home."@g]

64
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:29,158
Meanwhile the lion went back into the cave.

65
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:33,421
His chest was puffed out, and he wore a big smile.

66
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:36,481
"What happened out there?" asked the elephant.

67
00:04:36,482 --> 00:04:39,766
"Did you scare away Sun Wukong?"

68
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:43,620
"Not exactly," said the lion.

69
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:47,975
"Well, where is he?" asked the raptor.

70
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:49,793
[g@The lion patted his belly.

71
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:52,876
"He's in here."@g]

72
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:56,688
"You ate him?" asked the elephant.

73
00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:01,435
"I did," said the lion.

74
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:03,574
[g@The raptor shook his head.

75
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:08,134
"That was a bad idea."@g]

76
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:10,633
"Why?" asked the lion.

77
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:14,674
"Sun Wukong is immortal," said the raptor.

78
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:19,646
"He's probably still alive inside you."

79
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:22,274
[g@"Yes, I am still alive!"

80
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:24,614
Wukong suddenly shouted.@g]

81
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:30,975
"It's nice and warm in here!"
