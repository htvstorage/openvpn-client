1
00:00:11,000 --> 142:18:31,000
Wukong struggled to free himself from the golden rope.

2
142:20:11,000 --> 243:38:31,000
The gourd fell from his robe.

3
243:40:11,000 --> 404:40:11,000
"My magic gourd!" said Golden Horn, picking it up.

4
404:41:51,000 --> 684:30:11,000
He dragged Wukong to a dark room in the cave and locked him in.

5
684:31:51,000 --> 837:15:11,000
Right away Wukong made himself tiny and escaped.

6
837:16:51,000 --> 982:05:11,000
He flew down a tunnel and squeezed through the cave's main door.

7
982:06:51,000 --> 1132:25:11,000
Once he was outside, he returned to his normal size.

8
1132:26:51,000 --> 1190:31:51,000
[g@He banged on the cave door.

9
1190:33:31,000 --> 1272:48:31,000
"Open up right now!"@g]

10
1272:50:11,000 --> 1391:35:11,000
The door flew open and Golden Horn appeared.

11
1391:36:51,000 --> 1490:36:51,000
[g@"Sun Wukong!" shouted the demon.

12
1490:38:31,000 --> 1564:58:31,000
"How did you escape?"@g]

13
1565:00:11,000 --> 1697:51:51,000
"I'm not Sun Wukong," the monkey lied.

14
1697:53:31,000 --> 1831:16:51,000
"But you look just like him," said Golden Horn.

15
1831:18:31,000 --> 1908:15:11,000
"Yes, I do," said Wukong.

16
1908:16:51,000 --> 1989:23:31,000
[g@"Sun Wukong is my twin brother.

17
1989:25:11,000 --> 2095:15:11,000
My name is Sun Kongwu."@g]

18
2095:16:51,000 --> 2238:26:51,000
"Why are you here, Sun Kongwu?" asked Golden Horn.

19
2238:28:31,000 --> 2332:05:11,000
[g@"I know you captured my brother," said Wukong.

20
2332:06:51,000 --> 2483:50:11,000
"Set him free."@g]

21
2483:51:51,000 --> 2536:28:31,000
[g@Golden Horn laughed.

22
2536:30:11,000 --> 2634:05:11,000
"I'm not going to do that!"@g]

23
2634:06:51,000 --> 2772:23:31,000
"Oh, that's too bad," said Wukong, pretending to feel bad.

24
2772:25:11,000 --> 2888:28:31,000
"I was hoping to solve this problem without violence."

25
2888:30:11,000 --> 3037:16:51,000
He took the iron bar out of his ear.

26
3037:18:31,000 --> 3159:10:11,000
Golden Horn had been holding the gourd behind his back the whole time.

27
3159:11:51,000 --> 3374:26:51,000
He quickly held it up and shouted, "Sun Kongwu!"

28
3374:28:31,000 --> 3493:20:11,000
[i@Shloomp!@i] Wukong was sucked into the gourd.

29
3493:21:51,000 --> 3669:25:11,000
Golden Horn put a cap on the gourd and went back into his cave.

30
3669:26:51,000 --> 3788:01:51,000
[g@Inside the gourd Wukong stamped his foot.

31
3788:03:31,000 --> 3850:50:11,000
"How will I get out of here?@g]

32
3850:51:51,000 --> 3974:06:51,000
I know I won't turn into liquid because I'm going to live forever.

33
3974:08:31,000 --> 4074:56:51,000
But I still have to save my friends."

34
4074:58:31,000 --> 4162:21:51,000
[g@He tapped his chin.

35
4162:23:31,000 --> 4245:01:51,000
"I have an idea."@g]

36
4245:03:31,000 --> 4374:16:51,000
He plucked a hair and made it look almost exactly like himself.

37
4374:18:31,000 --> 4446:01:51,000
[g@There was just one difference.

38
4446:03:31,000 --> 4536:28:31,000
The fake Wukong had no legs.@g]

39
4536:30:11,000 --> 4623:35:11,000
Next Wukong made a hair look like a puddle.

40
4623:36:51,000 --> 4717:41:51,000
He placed the fake Wukong on the puddle.

41
4717:43:31,000 --> 4857:16:51,000
Now it looked as if the fake Wukong's legs had turned into liquid.

42
4857:18:31,000 --> 4966:20:11,000
Then the monkey made himself very, very tiny.

43
4966:21:51,000 --> 5266:51:51,000
Wukong went near the opening of the gourd and [n@shouted, "Oh no! My legs turned into liquid!"

44
5266:53:31,000 --> 5412:20:11,000
The gourd shot out light as Golden Horn removed the cap.

45
5412:21:51,000 --> 5537:55:11,000
The tiny Wukong leaped out, unseen.

46
5537:56:51,000 --> 5680:30:11,000
Golden Horn peered into the gourd and saw the fake Wukong in the puddle.

47
5680:31:51,000 --> 5816:26:51,000
"Ha-ha! The monkey's legs did turn into liquid.

48
5816:28:31,000 --> 5972:08:31,000
Soon his entire body will be liquid!"

49
5972:10:11,000 --> 6095:40:11,000
Golden Horn laughed again and closed the gourd.

50
6095:41:51,000 --> 6191:05:11,000
He put the gourd down and started eating.

51
6191:06:51,000 --> 6424:10:11,000
The real Wukong returned to his normal size [n@and then made himself look like a demon.

52
6424:11:51,000 --> 6603:05:11,000
He walked over to Golden Horn.

53
6603:06:51,000 --> 6675:40:11,000
[g@"Hello, sir," said Wukong.

54
6675:41:51,000 --> 6741:30:11,000
"Are you enjoying your lunch?"@g]

55
6741:31:51,000 --> 6836:23:31,000
"Yes," said Golden Horn.

56
6836:25:11,000 --> 6899:26:51,000
[g@Wukong picked up the gourd.

57
6899:28:31,000 --> 6977:23:31,000
"Is Sun Kongwu still in here?"@g]

58
6977:25:11,000 --> 7060:33:31,000
[g@"Yes," said Golden Horn.

59
7060:35:11,000 --> 7175:36:51,000
"He will turn completely into liquid soon.@g]

60
7175:38:31,000 --> 7251:23:31,000
[g@Stop asking me questions.

61
7251:25:11,000 --> 7338:41:51,000
I'm trying to eat my lunch."@g]

62
7338:43:31,000 --> 7441:53:31,000
Golden Horn tilted his head to take a drink.

63
7441:55:11,000 --> 7557:51:51,000
Wukong slipped the gourd into his robe.

64
7557:53:31,000 --> 7658:33:31,000
He quickly made a fake gourd with one of his hairs.

65
7658:35:11,000 --> 7786:31:51,000
He put it on the table and then ran outside.

66
7786:33:31,000 --> 7950:01:51,000
Wukong changed back into himself and then banged on the cave door again.

67
7950:03:31,000 --> 8032:03:31,000
Golden Horn threw the door open.

68
8032:05:11,000 --> 8141:18:31,000
"My name is Kong Sunwu," said Wukong.

69
8141:20:11,000 --> 8185:33:31,000
[g@"You captured my nephews.

70
8185:35:11,000 --> 8252:33:31,000
Return them at once!"@g]

71
8252:35:11,000 --> 8388:48:31,000
Golden Horn held up the fake gourd. "Kong Sunâ€”"

72
8388:50:11,000 --> 8505:53:31,000
"Wow!" cried Wukong, interrupting the demon.

73
8505:55:11,000 --> 8736:31:51,000
"I have a gourd that looks just like that!"
