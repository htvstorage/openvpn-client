1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,123
Wukong struggled to free himself from the golden rope.

2
00:00:16,124 --> 00:00:19,771
The gourd fell from his robe.

3
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:25,568
"My magic gourd!" said Golden Horn, picking it up.

4
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:35,642
He dragged Wukong to a dark room in the cave and locked him in.

5
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:41,141
Right away Wukong made himself tiny and escaped.

6
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:46,355
He flew down a tunnel and squeezed through the cave's main door.

7
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:51,767
Once he was outside, he returned to his normal size.

8
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:53,859
He banged on the cave door.

9
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,821
"Open up right now!"

10
00:00:56,822 --> 00:01:01,097
The door flew open and Golden Horn appeared.

11
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:04,662
"Sun Wukong!" shouted the demon.

12
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:07,339
"How did you escape?"

13
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,123
"I'm not Sun Wukong," the monkey lied.

14
00:01:12,124 --> 00:01:16,926
"But you look just like him," said Golden Horn.

15
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:19,697
"Yes, I do," said Wukong.

16
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:22,618
"Sun Wukong is my twin brother.

17
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,429
My name is Sun Kongwu."

18
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,584
"Why are you here, Sun Kongwu?" asked Golden Horn.

19
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:34,955
"I know you captured my brother," said Wukong.

20
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:40,418
"Set him free."

21
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:42,313
Golden Horn laughed.

22
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:45,827
"I'm not going to do that!"

23
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:50,806
"Oh, that's too bad," said Wukong, pretending to feel bad.

24
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:54,985
"I was hoping to solve this problem without violence."

25
00:01:54,986 --> 00:02:00,342
He took the iron bar out of his ear.

26
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:04,730
Golden Horn had been holding the gourd behind his back the whole time.

27
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:12,480
He quickly held it up and shouted, "Sun Kongwu!"

28
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:16,760
Shloomp! Wukong was sucked into the gourd.

29
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:23,099
Golden Horn put a cap on the gourd and went back into his cave.

30
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,369
Inside the gourd Wukong stamped his foot.

31
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,630
"How will I get out of here?

32
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:34,068
I know I won't turn into liquid because I'm going to live forever.

33
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:37,698
But I still have to save my friends."

34
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,845
He tapped his chin.

35
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:43,821
"I have an idea."

36
00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:48,474
He plucked a hair and made it look almost exactly like himself.

37
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:51,057
There was just one difference.

38
00:02:51,058 --> 00:02:54,313
The fake Wukong had no legs.

39
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:57,449
Next Wukong made a hair look like a puddle.

40
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,837
He placed the fake Wukong on the puddle.

41
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:05,862
Now it looked as if the fake Wukong's legs had turned into liquid.

42
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:09,788
Then the monkey made himself very, very tiny.

43
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:20,607
Wukong went near the opening of the gourd and shouted, "Oh no! My legs turned into liquid!"

44
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:25,844
The gourd shot out light as Golden Horn removed the cap.

45
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:30,365
The tiny Wukong leaped out, unseen.

46
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:35,498
Golden Horn peered into the gourd and saw the fake Wukong in the puddle.

47
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:40,392
"Ha-ha! The monkey's legs did turn into liquid.

48
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:45,997
Soon his entire body will be liquid!"

49
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:50,444
Golden Horn laughed again and closed the gourd.

50
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:53,879
He put the gourd down and started eating.

51
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:02,270
The real Wukong returned to his normal size and then made himself look like a demon.

52
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:08,711
He walked over to Golden Horn.

53
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:11,324
"Hello, sir," said Wukong.

54
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,694
"Are you enjoying your lunch?"

55
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:17,110
"Yes," said Golden Horn.

56
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,380
Wukong picked up the gourd.

57
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:22,186
"Is Sun Kongwu still in here?"

58
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:25,180
"Yes," said Golden Horn.

59
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,322
"He will turn completely into liquid soon.

60
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:32,050
Stop asking me questions.

61
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:35,193
I'm trying to eat my lunch."

62
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:38,908
Golden Horn tilted his head to take a drink.

63
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:43,083
Wukong slipped the gourd into his robe.

64
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:46,708
He quickly made a fake gourd with one of his hairs.

65
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:51,315
He put it on the table and then ran outside.

66
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:57,201
Wukong changed back into himself and then banged on the cave door again.

67
00:04:57,202 --> 00:05:00,154
Golden Horn threw the door open.

68
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:04,087
"My name is Kong Sunwu," said Wukong.

69
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:05,680
"You captured my nephews.

70
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,092
Return them at once!"

71
00:05:08,093 --> 00:05:12,997
Golden Horn held up the fake gourd. "Kong Sunâ€”"

72
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:17,212
"Wow!" cried Wukong, interrupting the demon.

73
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:25,515
"I have a gourd that looks just like that!"
