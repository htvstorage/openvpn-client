00:00:11,000 --> 127:28:31,000
"Wukong is right," said Bajie.

2
127:30:11,000 --> 311:48:31,000
"We should all go home and forget about reaching the Western Paradise.

3
311:50:11,000 --> 411:55:11,000
I'll return to my cave and take a nice long nap."

4
411:56:51,000 --> 509:16:51,000
Bajie started to walk away.

5
509:18:31,000 --> 550:06:51,000
[g@Wujing grabbed him.

6
550:08:31,000 --> 593:30:11,000
"Are you crazy?"@g]

7
593:31:51,000 --> 644:45:11,000
[g@He looked at Wukong.

8
644:46:51,000 --> 699:58:31,000
"We can't go home!"@g]

9
700:00:11,000 --> 775:20:11,000
"I know that," said the monkey.

10
775:21:51,000 --> 868:28:31,000
[g@"I wasn't serious about going home.

11
868:30:11,000 --> 927:13:31,000
But I'm angry with Master.@g]

12
927:15:11,000 --> 1032:15:11,000
[g@How many times have I warned him about demons?

13
1032:16:51,000 --> 1116:33:31,000
He never believes me!@g]

14
1116:35:11,000 --> 1259:18:31,000
If he had listened to me earlier, he wouldn't have been kidnapped."

15
1259:20:11,000 --> 1382:55:11,000
Wukong sighed. "We need to figure out where the demon took him.

16
1382:56:51,000 --> 1447:53:31,000
I'll summon a local spirit."

17
1447:55:11,000 --> 1553:53:31,000
The monkey closed his eyes and muttered some words.

18
1553:55:11,000 --> 1695:01:51,000
A soft breeze blew, and then a spirit appeared.

19
1695:03:31,000 --> 1791:50:11,000
[g@"Hello, Sun Wukong," said the spirit.

20
1791:51:51,000 --> 1884:31:51,000
"I am the spirit of this mountain."@g]

21
1884:33:31,000 --> 1978:25:11,000
"Our master was kidnapped by a demon," said Wukong.

22
1978:26:51,000 --> 2081:38:31,000
"We think the demon lives near here, but we don't know where."

23
2081:40:11,000 --> 2154:40:11,000
[g@"Oh dear," said the spirit.

24
2154:41:51,000 --> 2203:11:51,000
He looked nervous.@g]

25
2203:13:31,000 --> 2371:56:51,000
"Your master was probably kidnapped by Red Boy, a very nasty demon.

26
2371:58:31,000 --> 2460:21:51,000
His cave is near the peak of that mountain."

27
2460:23:31,000 --> 2555:30:11,000
The spirit pointed to a nearby mountain.

28
2555:31:51,000 --> 2661:35:11,000
"You shouldn't go there though," the spirit continued.

29
2661:36:51,000 --> 2737:21:51,000
"Red Boy is very powerful.

30
2737:23:31,000 --> 2934:38:31,000
His father is the Bull Demon King, one of the most horrible demons ever."

31
2934:40:11,000 --> 3111:00:11,000
A smile spread across Wukong's face, and he began to laugh.

32
3111:01:51,000 --> 3157:58:31,000
"That is good news!"

33
3158:00:11,000 --> 3252:35:11,000
Everyone looked at the monkey in surprise.

34
3252:36:51,000 --> 3353:53:31,000
"Why is that good news?" asked Wujing.

35
3353:55:11,000 --> 3478:45:11,000
"The Bull Demon King is an old friend of mine!" said Wukong.

36
3478:46:51,000 --> 3614:26:51,000
"Before I caused trouble in Heaven, I was friends [n@with a group of demon kings.

37
3614:28:31,000 --> 3689:31:51,000
The Bull Demon King was one of them.

38
3689:33:31,000 --> 3849:11:51,000
When I tell Red Boy who I am, he'll release the Tang Monk right away!"

39
3849:13:31,000 --> 4013:28:31,000
The three travelers said good-bye to the spirit and headed up the mountain.

40
4013:30:11,000 --> 4131:40:11,000
[g@They came to a cave near the peak.

41
4131:41:51,000 --> 4209:26:51,000
The door was closed.@g]

42
4209:28:31,000 --> 4296:18:31,000
[g@Wukong knocked. "Open up, Red Boy.

43
4296:20:11,000 --> 4366:55:11,000
I need to speak with you!"@g]

44
4366:56:51,000 --> 4550:55:11,000
The door flew open, and Red Boy stepped out.

45
4550:56:51,000 --> 4630:21:51,000
[g@"Who are you?" demanded Red Boy.

46
4630:23:31,000 --> 4677:33:31,000
"What do you want?"@g]

47
4677:35:11,000 --> 4780:06:51,000
"You kidnapped our master, the Tang Monk," said the monkey.

48
4780:08:31,000 --> 4843:36:51,000
"Please return him to us."

49
4843:38:31,000 --> 4969:40:11,000
Red Boy snorted. "I'm not going to return the Tang Monk to you.

50
4969:41:51,000 --> 5046:50:11,000
I'm going to eat him and live forever.

51
5046:51:51,000 --> 5209:36:51,000
Now go away before I get very angry!"

52
5209:38:31,000 --> 5385:56:51,000
Wukong laughed. "My dear boy, you don't realize whom you're talking to.

53
5385:58:31,000 --> 5466:28:31,000
[g@I am Sun Wukongâ€”the Monkey King.

54
5466:30:11,000 --> 5573:46:51,000
Your father and I are old friends."@g]

55
5573:48:31,000 --> 5667:36:51,000
"I don't care who you are!" said Red Boy.

56
5667:38:31,000 --> 5780:15:11,000
"Now all of you, get off my mountain!"

57
5780:16:51,000 --> 5885:10:11,000
Wukong shook his head, pretending to be disappointed.

58
5885:11:51,000 --> 5981:20:11,000
"I was hoping we could solve this problem nicely."

59
5981:21:51,000 --> 6110:20:11,000
He removed the iron bar from his ear.

60
6110:21:51,000 --> 6271:01:51,000
Red Boy laughed. "Do you think I'm scared of your little weapon?"

61
6271:03:31,000 --> 6378:43:31,000
"This iron bar is a treasure from Heaven," said Wukong.

62
6378:45:11,000 --> 6459:35:11,000
"It was used to measure the oceans and rivers.

63
6459:36:51,000 --> 6636:06:51,000
It is very powerful and can do whatever I tell it to do."

64
6636:08:31,000 --> 6710:00:11,000
The monkey puffed out his chest.

65
6710:01:51,000 --> 6842:48:31,000
"Now return the Tang Monk at once, or I'll destroy your entire mountain!"

66
6842:50:11,000 --> 6961:13:31,000
[g@"I also have a powerful weapon," said Red Boy.

67
6961:15:11,000 --> 7033:46:51,000
"I'll show it to you."@g]

68
7033:48:31,000 --> 7137:33:31,000
The demon punched himself in the nose.

69
7137:35:11,000 --> 7364:50:11,000
Smoke poured from his nostrils, and fire shot from his mouth.

70
7364:51:51,000 --> 7640:23:31,000
A moment later flames covered the entire mountainside!
