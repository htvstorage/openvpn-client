1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,589
"Wukong is right," said Bajie.

2
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:22,225
"We should all go home and forget about reaching the Western Paradise.

3
00:00:22,226 --> 00:00:25,829
I'll return to my cave and take a nice long nap."

4
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,334
Bajie started to walk away.

5
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:30,804
[g@Wujing grabbed him.

6
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:32,366
"Are you crazy?"@g]

7
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,211
[g@He looked at Wukong.

8
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:36,199
"We can't go home!"@g]

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,912
"I know that," said the monkey.

10
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:42,265
[g@"I wasn't serious about going home.

11
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:44,380
But I'm angry with Master.@g]

12
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:48,161
[g@How many times have I warned him about demons?

13
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:51,196
He never believes me!@g]

14
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:56,335
If he had listened to me earlier, he wouldn't have been kidnapped."

15
00:00:56,336 --> 00:01:00,785
Wukong sighed. "We need to figure out where the demon took him.

16
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:03,124
I'll summon a local spirit."

17
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,940
The monkey closed his eyes and muttered some words.

18
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:12,021
A soft breeze blew, and then a spirit appeared.

19
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:15,506
[g@"Hello, Sun Wukong," said the spirit.

20
00:01:15,507 --> 00:01:18,843
"I am the spirit of this mountain."@g]

21
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:22,223
"Our master was kidnapped by a demon," said Wukong.

22
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:25,939
"We think the demon lives near here, but we don't know where."

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,568
[g@"Oh dear," said the spirit.

24
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:30,315
He looked nervous.@g]

25
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:36,390
"Your master was probably kidnapped by Red Boy, a very nasty demon.

26
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:39,573
His cave is near the peak of that mountain."

27
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:42,998
The spirit pointed to a nearby mountain.

28
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:46,817
"You shouldn't go there though," the spirit continued.

29
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:49,545
"Red Boy is very powerful.

30
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:56,647
His father is the Bull Demon King, one of the most horrible demons ever."

31
00:01:56,648 --> 00:02:02,996
A smile spread across Wukong's face, and he began to laugh.

32
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,687
"That is good news!"

33
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:08,093
Everyone looked at the monkey in surprise.

34
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,740
"Why is that good news?" asked Wujing.

35
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:16,235
"The Bull Demon King is an old friend of mine!" said Wukong.

36
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:21,120
"Before I caused trouble in Heaven, I was friends [n@with a group of demon kings.

37
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,823
The Bull Demon King was one of them.

38
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:29,571
When I tell Red Boy who I am, he'll release the Tang Monk right away!"

39
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:35,485
The three travelers said good-bye to the spirit and headed up the mountain.

40
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:39,740
[g@They came to a cave near the peak.

41
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:42,540
The door was closed.@g]

42
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,667
[g@Wukong knocked. "Open up, Red Boy.

43
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:48,209
I need to speak with you!"@g]

44
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:54,833
The door flew open, and Red Boy stepped out.

45
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,693
[g@"Who are you?" demanded Red Boy.

46
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,392
"What do you want?"@g]

47
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:03,084
"You kidnapped our master, the Tang Monk," said the monkey.

48
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:05,370
"Please return him to us."

49
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:09,908
Red Boy snorted. "I'm not going to return the Tang Monk to you.

50
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:12,686
I'm going to eat him and live forever.

51
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:18,546
Now go away before I get very angry!"

52
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:24,894
Wukong laughed. "My dear boy, you don't realize whom you're talking to.

53
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:27,793
[g@I am Sun Wukongâ€”the Monkey King.

54
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:31,656
Your father and I are old friends."@g]

55
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:35,034
"I don't care who you are!" said Red Boy.

56
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:39,089
"Now all of you, get off my mountain!"

57
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,866
Wukong shook his head, pretending to be disappointed.

58
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:46,328
"I was hoping we could solve this problem nicely."

59
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:50,972
He removed the iron bar from his ear.

60
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:56,757
Red Boy laughed. "Do you think I'm scared of your little weapon?"

61
00:03:56,758 --> 00:04:00,634
"This iron bar is a treasure from Heaven," said Wukong.

62
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:03,545
"It was used to measure the oceans and rivers.

63
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:09,900
It is very powerful and can do whatever I tell it to do."

64
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:12,560
The monkey puffed out his chest.

65
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:17,341
"Now return the Tang Monk at once, or I'll destroy your entire mountain!"

66
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:21,604
[g@"I also have a powerful weapon," said Red Boy.

67
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:24,216
"I'll show it to you."@g]

68
00:04:24,217 --> 00:04:27,952
The demon punched himself in the nose.

69
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:36,134
Smoke poured from his nostrils, and fire shot from his mouth.

70
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:46,054
A moment later flames covered the entire mountainside!
