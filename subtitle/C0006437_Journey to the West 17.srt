1
00:00:11,200 --> 144:05:11,200
[g@"That dragon ate my horse!" said the monk.

2
144:06:51,200 --> 208:48:31,200
He fell to his knees.@g]

3
208:50:11,200 --> 292:38:31,200
"How will I ever get to the Western Paradise?

4
292:40:11,200 --> 370:15:11,200
There are so many dangers along the way!"

5
370:16:51,200 --> 494:35:11,200
Wukong laughed. "Master, you worry too much.

6
494:36:51,200 --> 594:26:51,200
There will be many dangers on your journey.

7
594:28:31,200 --> 701:06:51,200
But you have me, the Monkey King, to protect you.

8
701:08:31,200 --> 766:53:31,200
[g@All of Heaven's soldiers couldn't defeat me.

9
766:55:11,200 --> 1007:43:31,200
So why worry about a dragon?"@g]

10
1007:45:11,200 --> 1162:53:31,200
The monkey stepped into the water and pulled out his iron bar.

11
1162:55:11,200 --> 1243:50:11,200
"I'll get the dragon to come out of the water."

12
1243:51:51,200 --> 1300:11:51,200
[g@He looked down at the water.

13
1300:13:31,200 --> 1443:16:51,200
"Dragon! Get up here right now!"@g]

14
1443:18:31,200 --> 1528:46:51,200
The dragon leaped from the water.

15
1528:48:31,200 --> 1615:55:11,200
[g@"How dare you yell at me!

16
1615:56:51,200 --> 1701:30:11,200
Who are you?"@g]

17
1701:31:51,200 --> 1804:20:11,200
[g@"It doesn't matter who I am!" shouted Wukong.

18
1804:21:51,200 --> 1881:18:31,200
"Give that horse back!"@g]

19
1881:20:11,200 --> 2044:45:11,200
The monkey attacked the dragon with his iron bar.

20
2044:46:51,200 --> 2141:50:11,200
The dragon spun around, blocking the bar with his tail.

21
2141:51:51,200 --> 2246:56:51,200
Then with a splash, he dived back underwater.

22
2246:58:31,200 --> 2442:38:31,200
Wukong stomped his foot and yelled at the river. "Coward!"

23
2442:40:11,200 --> 2516:40:11,200
[g@"What will we do?" asked the Tang Monk.

24
2516:41:51,200 --> 2599:01:51,200
"I have no horse."@g]

25
2599:03:31,200 --> 2738:53:31,200
Wukong nodded. "And we can't cross the river with that dragon in there.

26
2738:55:11,200 --> 2824:35:11,200
I'll try another plan."

27
2824:36:51,200 --> 2924:15:11,200
[g@The monkey swirled the water with his iron bar.

28
2924:16:51,200 --> 2975:25:11,200
The water became rough.@g]

29
2975:26:51,200 --> 3062:50:11,200
Waves crashed and churned.

30
3062:51:51,200 --> 3159:48:31,200
The water dragged up dirt from the river bottom.

31
3159:50:11,200 --> 3264:35:11,200
Soon the river was brown and muddy.

32
3264:36:51,200 --> 3350:11:51,200
The dragon appeared again.

33
3350:13:31,200 --> 3462:05:11,200
[g@"What on earth are you doing now?" he cried.

34
3462:06:51,200 --> 3553:41:51,200
"I'm trying to take a nap!"@g]

35
3553:43:31,200 --> 3652:05:11,200
"Give us back our horse!" demanded Wukong.

36
3652:06:51,200 --> 3728:48:31,200
[g@"I can't!" cried the dragon.

37
3728:50:11,200 --> 3831:45:11,200
"It's in my stomach!"@g]

38
3831:46:51,200 --> 3958:56:51,200
The monkey attacked the dragon again.

39
3958:58:31,200 --> 4107:26:51,200
But once more the dragon disappeared under the water.

40
4107:28:31,200 --> 4221:50:11,200
For more than three hours, Wukong yelled at the river.

41
4221:51:51,200 --> 4290:31:51,200
[g@He yelled all kinds of insults.

42
4290:33:31,200 --> 4403:40:11,200
But the dragon would not come back up.@g]

43
4403:41:51,200 --> 4633:48:31,200
Wukong climbed up the riverbank and sat down next to the Tang Monk.

44
4633:50:11,200 --> 4699:10:11,200
"That dragon is tough.

45
4699:11:51,200 --> 4778:43:31,200
[g@I'm not afraid of him, but I can't beat him either.

46
4778:45:11,200 --> 4837:41:51,200
I need help."@g]

47
4837:43:31,200 --> 4921:28:31,200
"Who can help you?" asked the Tang Monk.

48
4921:30:11,200 --> 4995:50:11,200
Wukong thought for a moment.

49
4995:51:51,200 --> 5100:21:51,200
"Guanyin told me I can ask her for help if I need it."

50
5100:23:31,200 --> 5166:13:31,200
[g@"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

51
5166:15:11,200 --> 5226:36:51,200
"She told me the same thing."@g]

52
5226:38:31,200 --> 5331:06:51,200
Wukong felt the headband and shot a look at the monk.

53
5331:08:31,200 --> 5381:05:11,200
[g@"She already did help you.

54
5381:06:51,200 --> 5474:38:31,200
She gave you this tight headband."@g]

55
5474:40:11,200 --> 5527:06:51,200
[g@He sighed.

56
5527:08:31,200 --> 5616:38:31,200
"But that doesn't matter now.@g]

57
5616:40:11,200 --> 5642:01:51,200
[g@You wait here.

58
5642:03:31,200 --> 5685:41:51,200
I'll be back soon."@g]

59
5685:43:31,200 --> 5852:55:11,200
Wukong shot into the air and flew south.

60
5852:56:51,200 --> 5966:20:11,200
Soon he came to Mount Potalaka in the South Sea.

61
5966:21:51,200 --> 6081:31:51,200
[g@Guanyin was in a garden next to her pagoda.

62
6081:33:31,200 --> 6153:05:11,200
"Hello, Wukong," she said.@g]

63
6153:06:51,200 --> 6217:50:11,200
[g@"How is the journey going?

64
6217:51:51,200 --> 6313:13:31,200
I see you're wearing the headband."@g]

65
6313:15:11,200 --> 6421:45:11,200
"Yes, thanks to your dirty tricks!" said the monkey.

66
6421:46:51,200 --> 6558:23:31,200
Guanyin smiled. "You need that headband, Wukong.

67
6558:25:11,200 --> 6648:30:11,200
You are too violent and cruel."

68
6648:31:51,200 --> 6729:11:51,200
[g@Wukong rolled his eyes.

69
6729:13:31,200 --> 6826:01:51,200
"Fine. I'm here because I have a problem.@g]

70
6826:03:31,200 --> 6895:41:51,200
[g@We reached a wide river with a dragon in it.

71
6895:43:31,200 --> 6982:00:11,200
The dragon ate our horse."@g]

72
6982:01:51,200 --> 7138:01:51,200
"Did you tell the dragon that you're traveling [n@with the Tang Monk?" asked Guanyin.

73
7138:03:31,200 --> 7239:20:11,200
"No," said the monkey. "Why?"

74
7239:21:51,200 --> 7417:00:11,200
Guanyin sighed. "That dragon was waiting for you.

75
7417:01:51,200 --> 7578:31:51,200
When I met him, he was being punished for [n@setting fire to his father's palace.

76
7578:33:31,200 --> 7705:23:31,200
I told him to help the Tang Monk reach the Western Paradise.

77
7705:25:11,200 --> 7812:06:51,200
That way he can earn forgiveness."

78
7812:08:31,200 --> 7883:06:51,200
Wukong scratched his head.

79
7883:08:31,200 --> 7938:35:11,200
[g@"It's too late for that now.

80
7938:36:51,200 --> 8107:31:51,200
He won't come out of the water."@g]
