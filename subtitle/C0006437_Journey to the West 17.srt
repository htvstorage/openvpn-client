1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,387
[g@"That dragon ate my horse!" said the monk.

2
00:00:16,388 --> 00:00:18,717
He fell to his knees.@g]

3
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,735
"How will I ever get to the Western Paradise?

4
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:24,529
There are so many dangers along the way!"

5
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,005
Wukong laughed. "Master, you worry too much.

6
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:32,600
There will be many dangers on your journey.

7
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:36,440
But you have me, the Monkey King, to protect you.

8
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:38,808
[g@All of Heaven's soldiers couldn't defeat me.

9
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:47,478
So why worry about a dragon?"@g]

10
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:53,064
The monkey stepped into the water and pulled out his iron bar.

11
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:55,978
"I'll get the dragon to come out of the water."

12
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:58,007
[g@He looked down at the water.

13
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:03,158
"Dragon! Get up here right now!"@g]

14
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,236
The dragon leaped from the water.

15
00:01:06,237 --> 00:01:09,373
[g@"How dare you yell at me!

16
00:01:09,374 --> 00:01:12,454
Who are you?"@g]

17
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:16,156
[g@"It doesn't matter who I am!" shouted Wukong.

18
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:18,927
"Give that horse back!"@g]

19
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:24,811
The monkey attacked the dragon with his iron bar.

20
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:28,306
The dragon spun around, blocking the bar with his tail.

21
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:32,090
Then with a splash, he dived back underwater.

22
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:39,135
Wukong stomped his foot and yelled at the river. "Coward!"

23
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:41,800
[g@"What will we do?" asked the Tang Monk.

24
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,765
"I have no horse."@g]

25
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:49,800
Wukong nodded. "And we can't cross the river with that dragon in there.

26
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,885
I'll try another plan."

27
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:56,473
[g@The monkey swirled the water with his iron bar.

28
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:58,315
The water became rough.@g]

29
00:01:58,316 --> 00:02:01,462
Waves crashed and churned.

30
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:04,953
The water dragged up dirt from the river bottom.

31
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:08,725
Soon the river was brown and muddy.

32
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:11,807
The dragon appeared again.

33
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:15,835
[g@"What on earth are you doing now?" he cried.

34
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:19,133
"I'm trying to take a nap!"@g]

35
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:22,675
"Give us back our horse!" demanded Wukong.

36
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,437
[g@"I can't!" cried the dragon.

37
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:29,143
"It's in my stomach!"@g]

38
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:33,722
The monkey attacked the dragon again.

39
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:39,068
But once more the dragon disappeared under the water.

40
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:43,186
For more than three hours, Wukong yelled at the river.

41
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:45,659
[g@He yelled all kinds of insults.

42
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,732
But the dragon would not come back up.@g]

43
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:58,017
Wukong climbed up the riverbank and sat down next to the Tang Monk.

44
00:02:58,018 --> 00:03:00,370
"That dragon is tough.

45
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:03,234
[g@I'm not afraid of him, but I can't beat him either.

46
00:03:03,235 --> 00:03:05,357
I need help."@g]

47
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:08,373
"Who can help you?" asked the Tang Monk.

48
00:03:08,374 --> 00:03:11,050
Wukong thought for a moment.

49
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,813
"Guanyin told me I can ask her for help if I need it."

50
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:17,184
[g@"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

51
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:19,358
"She told me the same thing."@g]

52
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:23,120
Wukong felt the headband and shot a look at the monk.

53
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,919
[g@"She already did help you.

54
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,287
She gave you this tight headband."@g]

55
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:30,176
[g@He sighed.

56
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:33,399
"But that doesn't matter now.@g]

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,313
[g@You wait here.

58
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,885
I'll be back soon."@g]

59
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:41,905
Wukong shot into the air and flew south.

60
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:45,988
Soon he came to Mount Potalaka in the South Sea.

61
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,135
[g@Guanyin was in a garden next to her pagoda.

62
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:52,711
"Hello, Wukong," she said.@g]

63
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:55,042
[g@"How is the journey going?

64
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:58,476
I see you're wearing the headband."@g]

65
00:03:58,477 --> 00:04:02,383
"Yes, thanks to your dirty tricks!" said the monkey.

66
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:07,302
Guanyin smiled. "You need that headband, Wukong.

67
00:04:07,303 --> 00:04:10,546
You are too violent and cruel."

68
00:04:10,547 --> 00:04:13,451
[g@Wukong rolled his eyes.

69
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:16,937
"Fine. I'm here because I have a problem.@g]

70
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:19,445
[g@We reached a wide river with a dragon in it.

71
00:04:19,446 --> 00:04:22,552
The dragon ate our horse."@g]

72
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:28,169
"Did you tell the dragon that you're traveling [n@with the Tang Monk?" asked Guanyin.

73
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,816
"No," said the monkey. "Why?"

74
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:38,212
Guanyin sighed. "That dragon was waiting for you.

75
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:44,027
When I met him, he was being punished for [n@setting fire to his father's palace.

76
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:48,594
I told him to help the Tang Monk reach the Western Paradise.

77
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:52,436
That way he can earn forgiveness."

78
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:54,992
Wukong scratched his head.

79
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:56,989
[g@"It's too late for that now.

80
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:03,071
He won't come out of the water."@g]
