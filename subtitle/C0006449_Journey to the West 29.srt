1
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:16,785
"I know we counted the fruit correctly," said one priest.

2
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:19,684
"But we'll count again anyway."

3
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:26,773
The two angry priests went outside and gasped.

4
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:30,369
The ginseng tree was lying on the ground.

5
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,855
It was gray, and all its leaves were gone.

6
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:37,658
"The tree is dead!" cried one priest.

7
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:41,100
"That monkey must have done this."

8
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:45,123
"But the monkey was inside the whole time," said the other priest.

9
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:48,567
"How could he have been out here also?"

10
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:51,184
"He's a spirit," said the first priest.

11
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:54,304
"He must have used magic."

12
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:56,961
He looked at the tree and shook his head.

13
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:59,315
"This tree was older than Heaven and Earth.

14
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:02,372
The monkey must be very powerful."

15
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:07,416
"It would be dangerous for us to fight him," said the other priest.

16
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:12,449
"Let's wait for our master, the Great Immortal, to return."

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,661
Inside the abbey the Tang Monk was scolding his companions.

18
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:20,772
"We are guests here," he said.

19
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:25,055
"I am very upset you stole fruit from our hosts."

20
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:28,686
The priests came back in.

21
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:32,169
"We owe you an apology," said one.

22
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,743
"None of the ginseng fruit is missing after all."

23
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:40,115
"Oh," said the Tang Monk. "I'm glad to hear that."

24
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:43,645
"Thank you for your apology," said Bajie.

25
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:47,393
Wukong gave the priests a suspicious look.

26
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:49,418
He knew they were lying.

27
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:52,855
But he didn't know why.

28
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:59,682
"You're all welcome to spend the night," said one of the priests. "Follow us."

29
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:04,030
The priests led the group to a small room in the abbey.

30
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:08,021
The Tang Monk and his companions went inside.

31
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:11,236
"This is a nice room," said Bajie.

32
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:14,804
Wukong noticed that the priests didn't come in.

33
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:21,074
He was about to say something when one priest slammed the door shut.

34
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,300
A lock clicked.

35
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:28,501
"Wait!" cried Bajie. "What kind of hosts are you?

36
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:30,594
You locked us in!"

37
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:36,188
Bam! He kicked the door. "Ow! My foot!"

38
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:40,828
Bajie fell to the floor, rubbing his foot.

39
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:44,514
"Why did they lock us in here?" asked the Tang Monk.

40
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:47,570
"They're afraid of us," said Wukong.

41
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:52,264
"I knocked down their ginseng tree."

42
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:54,946
"What?" cried the Tang Monk.

43
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:57,793
"I was angry at them," said Wukong.

44
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:04,918
"They're probably planning to keep us locked in here until their master comes back."

45
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,156
The Tang Monk glared at his companions.

46
00:03:08,157 --> 00:03:14,074
"How will I ever reach the Western Paradise with companions like you?" he asked.

47
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:15,804
Bajie stood up.

48
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:19,563
"It's not my fault. I was hungry."

49
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:22,398
Wujing looked at the ground.

50
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:25,549
"Master, don't worry," said Wukong.

51
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,276
"I'll get us out of here.

52
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:31,383
When the priests go to sleep, I'll use my lock-picking magic.

53
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:35,561
Then we'll be on our way."

54
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:41,990
The four travelers escaped that night and headed west.

55
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:45,728
The next day they saw an old man on the road.

56
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,420
"Excuse me," said the man.

57
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:51,398
"Did you come from the abbey?"

58
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:55,911
The Tang Monk glanced nervously at his companions.

59
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:58,439
"Um, yes," he said.

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,712
"I thought so," said the man.

61
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:05,159
He suddenly stood much taller.

62
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,208
"I am the Great Immortal!

63
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:11,661
You destroyed my ginseng tree.

64
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:16,676
You're not going any farther until you give me a new one!"

65
00:04:16,677 --> 00:04:20,169
Wukong pulled out his iron bar.

66
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,861
Bajie and Wujing raised their weapons.

67
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:29,230
The Great Immortal rose into the air and landed on a cloud.

68
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:34,791
Wukong laughed. "You think you're special just because you can fly?

69
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:37,297
We can do that too!"

70
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:40,751
The Great Immortal raised an eyebrow.

71
00:04:40,752 --> 00:04:42,370
"Can you do this?

72
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:47,028
It's called Magic of the Cosmos in the Sleeve."

73
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:49,790
The Great Immortal waved his arm.

74
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,160
His sleeve swooped down toward Wukong and his companions.

75
00:04:54,161 --> 00:05:01,595
Instantly they were all swept up in it.
