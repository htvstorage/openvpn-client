00:00:11,133.33300000000054 --> 157:00:11,133.3329999446869
"I know we counted the fruit correctly," said one priest.

2
157:01:51,133.3329999446869 --> 237:31:51,133.3329999446869
"But we'll count again anyway."

3
237:33:31,133.3329999446869 --> 434:26:51,133.3329999446869
The two angry priests went outside and gasped.

4
434:28:31,133.3329999446869 --> 534:20:11,133.3329999446869
The ginseng tree was lying on the ground.

5
534:21:51,133.3329999446869 --> 658:56:51,133.33300018310547
It was gray, and all its leaves were gone.

6
658:58:31,133.33300018310547 --> 736:48:31,133.33300018310547
[g@"The tree is dead!" cried one priest.

7
736:50:11,133.33300018310547 --> 832:25:11,133.33300018310547
"That monkey must have done this."@g]

8
832:26:51,133.33300018310547 --> 944:10:11,133.33300018310547
"But the monkey was inside the whole time," said the other priest.

9
944:11:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1039:50:11,133.33300018310547
"How could he have been out here also?"

10
1039:51:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1112:31:51,133.33300018310547
[g@"He's a spirit," said the first priest.

11
1112:33:31,133.33300018310547 --> 1199:11:51,133.33300018310547
"He must have used magic."@g]

12
1199:13:31,133.33300018310547 --> 1273:00:11,133.33300018310547
He looked at the tree and shook his head.

13
1273:01:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1338:23:31,133.33300018310547
"This tree was older than Heaven and Earth.

14
1338:25:11,133.33300018310547 --> 1423:18:31,133.33300018310547
The monkey must be very powerful."

15
1423:20:11,133.33300018310547 --> 1563:25:11,133.33300018310547
"It would be dangerous for us to fight him," said the other priest.

16
1563:26:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1703:13:31,133.33300018310547
"Let's wait for our master, the Great Immortal, to return."

17
1703:15:11,133.33300018310547 --> 1848:00:11,133.33300018310547
Inside the abbey the Tang Monk was scolding his companions.

18
1848:01:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1934:25:11,133.33300018310547
"We are guests here," he said.

19
1934:26:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2053:23:31,133.33300018310547
"I am very upset you stole fruit from our hosts."

20
2053:25:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2154:15:11,133.33300018310547
The priests came back in.

21
2154:16:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2251:00:11,133.33300018310547
"We owe you an apology," said one.

22
2251:01:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2350:16:51,133.33300018310547
"None of the ginseng fruit is missing after all."

23
2350:18:31,133.33300018310547 --> 2471:43:31,133.33300018310547
"Oh," said the Tang Monk. "I'm glad to hear that."

24
2471:45:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2569:46:51,133.33300018310547
"Thank you for your apology," said Bajie.

25
2569:48:31,133.33300018310547 --> 2673:53:31,133.33300018310547
Wukong gave the priests a suspicious look.

26
2673:55:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2730:08:31,133.33300018310547
[g@He knew they were lying.

27
2730:10:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2825:36:51,133.33300018310547
But he didn't know why.@g]

28
2825:38:31,133.33300018310547 --> 3015:15:11,133.33300018310547
"You're all welcome to spend the night," [n@said one of the priests. "Follow us."

29
3015:16:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3136:01:51,133.33300018310547
The priests led the group to a small room in the abbey.

30
3136:03:31,133.33300018310547 --> 3246:53:31,133.33300018310547
The Tang Monk and his companions went inside.

31
3246:55:11,133.33300018310547 --> 3336:11:51,133.33300018310547
"This is a nice room," said Bajie.

32
3336:13:31,133.33300018310547 --> 3435:18:31,133.33300018310547
Wukong noticed that the priests didn't come in.

33
3435:20:11,133.33300018310547 --> 3609:28:31,133.33300018310547
He was about to say something when one priest slammed the door shut.

34
3609:30:11,133.33300018310547 --> 3699:05:11,133.33300018310547
A lock clicked.

35
3699:06:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3815:46:51,133.33300018310547
[g@"Wait!" cried Bajie. "What kind of hosts are you?

36
3815:48:31,133.33300018310547 --> 3873:55:11,133.33300018310547
You locked us in!"@g]

37
3873:56:51,133.33300018310547 --> 4029:18:31,133.33300018310547
[i@Bam!@i] He kicked the door. "Ow! My foot!"

38
4029:20:11,133.33300018310547 --> 4158:11:51,133.33300018310547
Bajie fell to the floor, rubbing his foot.

39
4158:13:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4260:35:11,133.33300018310547
"Why did they lock us in here?" asked the Tang Monk.

40
4260:36:51,133.33300018310547 --> 4345:28:31,133.33300018310547
[g@"They're afraid of us," said Wukong.

41
4345:30:11,133.33300018310547 --> 4475:51:51,133.33300018310547
"I knocked down their ginseng tree."@g]

42
4475:53:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4550:21:51,133.33300018310547
"What?" cried the Tang Monk.

43
4550:23:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4629:26:51,133.33300018310547
"I was angry at them," said Wukong.

44
4629:28:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4827:21:51,133.33300018310547
"They're probably planning to keep us locked [n@in here until their master comes back."

45
4827:23:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4917:18:31,133.33300018310547
The Tang Monk glared at his companions.

46
4917:20:11,133.33300018310547 --> 5081:41:51,133.33300018310547
"How will I ever reach the Western Paradise [n@with companions like you?" he asked.

47
5081:43:31,133.33300018310547 --> 5129:45:11,133.33300018310547
[g@Bajie stood up.

48
5129:46:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5234:10:11,133.33300018310547
"It's not my fault. I was hungry."@g]

49
5234:11:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5312:55:11,133.33300018310547
Wujing looked at the ground.

50
5312:56:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5400:26:51,133.33300018310547
[g@"Master, don't worry," said Wukong.

51
5400:28:31,133.33300018310547 --> 5448:25:11,133.33300018310547
"I'll get us out of here.@g]

52
5448:26:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5562:30:11,133.33300018310547
When the priests go to sleep, I'll use my lock-picking magic.

53
5562:31:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5678:33:31,133.33300018310547
Then we'll be on our way."

54
5678:35:11,133.33300018310547 --> 5857:08:31,133.33300018310547
The four travelers escaped that night and headed west.

55
5857:10:11,133.33300018310547 --> 5960:58:31,133.33300018310547
The next day they saw an old man on the road.

56
5961:00:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6035:45:11,133.33300018310547
[g@"Excuse me," said the man.

57
6035:46:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6118:28:31,133.33300018310547
"Did you come from the abbey?"@g]

58
6118:30:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6243:50:11,133.33300018310547
[g@The Tang Monk glanced nervously at his companions.

59
6243:51:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6314:03:31,133.33300018310547
"Um, yes," he said.@g]

60
6314:05:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6404:58:31,133.33300018310547
[g@"I thought so," said the man.

61
6405:00:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6500:43:31,133.33300018310547
He suddenly stood much taller.@g]

62
6500:45:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6585:25:11,133.33300018310547
[g@"I am the Great Immortal!

63
6585:26:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6681:20:11,133.33300018310547
You destroyed my ginseng tree.@g]

64
6681:21:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6820:38:31,133.33300018310547
You're not going any farther until you give me a new one!"

65
6820:40:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6917:40:11,133.33300018310547
[g@Wukong pulled out his iron bar.

66
6917:41:51,133.33300018310547 --> 7020:13:31,133.33300018310547
Bajie and Wujing raised their weapons.@g]

67
7020:15:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7169:21:51,133.33300018310547
The Great Immortal rose into the air and landed on a cloud.

68
7169:23:31,133.33300018310547 --> 7323:50:11,133.33300018310547
Wukong laughed. "You think you're special just because you can fly?

69
7323:51:51,133.33300018310547 --> 7393:26:51,133.33300018310547
We can do that too!"

70
7393:28:31,133.33300018310547 --> 7489:23:31,133.33300018310547
The Great Immortal raised an eyebrow.

71
7489:25:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7534:21:51,133.33300018310547
[g@"Can you do this?

72
7534:23:31,133.33300018310547 --> 7663:45:11,133.33300018310547
It's called Magic of the Cosmos in the Sleeve."@g]

73
7663:46:51,133.33300018310547 --> 7740:28:31,133.33300018310547
The Great Immortal waved his arm.

74
7740:30:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7861:51:51,133.33300018310547
His sleeve swooped down toward Wukong and his companions.

75
7861:53:31,133.33300018310547 --> 8068:23:31,133.33300018310547
Instantly they were all swept up in it.
