00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 130:13:30,933.3330000042915
The monster yelled from inside the cave.

2
130:15:10,933.3330000042915 --> 185:01:50,933.3329999446869
[g@"We ate the Tang Monk!

3
185:03:30,933.3329999446869 --> 276:33:30,933.3329999446869
So you might as well leave!"@g]

4
276:35:10,933.3329999446869 --> 468:10:10,933.3329999446869
"Oh no!" Bajie fell to his knees and cried.

5
468:11:50,933.3329999446869 --> 548:56:50,933.3329999446869
[g@Wujing wiped tears from his eyes.

6
548:58:30,933.3329999446869 --> 622:55:10,933.3330001831055
"Poor Master."@g]

7
622:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 697:50:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong frowned at his companions.

8
697:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 797:03:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"I can't believe you two believe that monster."

9
797:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 913:26:50,933.3330001831055
He sighed. "Wait here."@g]

10
913:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1038:06:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey turned into a moth and flew into the cave.

11
1038:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1149:23:30,933.3330001831055
He soon found the Tang Monk tied up in a dark room.

12
1149:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1243:38:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong turned back into himself.

13
1243:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1319:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Wukong!" cried the Tang Monk.

14
1319:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1452:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Shh." The monkey untied the monk.

15
1452:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1530:23:30,933.3330001831055
"We must be quiet."@g]

16
1530:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1666:36:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong recited a spell.

17
1666:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1845:43:30,933.3330001831055
A moment later the sound of snoring drifted into the room.

18
1845:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2000:38:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"My spell put the monster and demons to sleep," said the monkey.

19
2000:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2094:13:30,933.3330001831055
"Let's go."@g]

20
2094:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2191:28:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong and the monk came out of the cave.

21
2191:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2263:45:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie and Wujing were thrilled.@g]

22
2263:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2394:26:50,933.3330001831055
"Master, we thought you'd been eaten," said Bajie.

23
2394:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2480:30:10,933.3330001831055
"I knew he was fine," said Wukong.

24
2480:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2619:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Now I'm going to make sure these villains never bother anyone again."

25
2619:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2748:40:10,933.3330001831055
He pulled out his iron bar.

26
2748:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2869:20:10,933.3330001831055
It grew until it was the size of a very tall tree.

27
2869:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3055:35:10,933.3330001831055
"Stand back," said the monkey.

28
3055:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3197:51:50,933.3330001831055
With one swing Wukong smashed the entire cave.

29
3197:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3326:23:30,933.3330001831055
Rocks exploded and fell on top of one another.

30
3326:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3468:55:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong looked at the rubble and smiled.

31
3468:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3600:13:30,933.3330001831055
Weeks went by, and the travelers arrived in a small town.

32
3600:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3691:35:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie's stomach growled loudly.

33
3691:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3746:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong laughed.

34
3746:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3826:58:30,933.3330001831055
"I guess we should look for food."@g]

35
3827:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3964:58:30,933.3330001831055
They saw an old monk walking down a street.

36
3965:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4031:38:30,933.3330001831055
"Kind monk," said the Tang Monk.

37
4031:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4102:31:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Do you know where we can beg for some food?

38
4102:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4157:53:30,933.3330001831055
We are quite hungry."@g]

39
4157:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4211:45:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The old monk nodded.

40
4211:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4297:40:10,933.3330001831055
"Go to Squire Kou's house.@g]

41
4297:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4441:26:50,933.3330001831055
The squire made a vow to feed ten thousand Buddhist monks.

42
4441:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4540:10:10,933.3330001831055
He will surely give you some food."

43
4540:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4638:40:10,933.3330001831055
He gave the Tang Monk directions to the house.

44
4638:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4736:01:50,933.3330001831055
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

45
4736:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4898:58:30,933.3330001831055
The travelers arrived at the squire's gate, and a servant let them in.

46
4899:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5017:31:50,933.3330001831055
The squire's house was very large and fancy.

47
5017:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5096:55:10,933.3330001831055
Squire Kou came outside.

48
5096:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5182:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Greetings," he said with a smile.

49
5182:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5253:48:30,933.3330001831055
"Please come inside."@g]

50
5253:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5360:53:30,933.3330001831055
The travelers sat with the squire in a large room.

51
5360:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5452:41:50,933.3330001831055
A servant brought tea and snacks.

52
5452:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5554:43:30,933.3330001831055
"Thank you for inviting us in, Squire," said the Tang Monk.

53
5554:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5660:11:50,933.3330001831055
"We heard that you made a vow to feed ten thousand monks."

54
5660:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5719:00:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Yes," said the squire.

55
5719:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5807:43:30,933.3330001831055
"I've made plenty of money during my life.@g]

56
5807:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5891:08:30,933.3330001831055
But I want to do good deeds as well.

57
5891:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6036:38:30,933.3330001831055
I hope to be reborn one day as a bodhisattva or even a buddha."

58
6036:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6179:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Well, Squire," said Bajie, "today's your lucky day!

59
6179:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6296:58:30,933.3330001831055
I can easily eat as much food as ten thousand monks.

60
6297:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6420:13:30,933.3330001831055
[g@So if you feed me, you'll definitely become a buddha!"

61
6420:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6506:01:50,933.3330001831055
Everybody laughed.@g]

62
6506:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6606:01:50,933.3330001831055
"It [i@is@i] my lucky day," said the squire.

63
6606:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6718:43:30,933.3330001831055
"Last night I checked to see how many monks I've fed.

64
6718:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6864:15:10,933.3330001831055
So far I've fed 9,996 monks.

65
6864:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6981:26:50,933.3330001831055
I need to feed only four more in order to fulfill my vow."

66
6981:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7070:03:30,933.3330001831055
[g@A smile spread across his face.

67
7070:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7165:50:10,933.3330001831055
"And there are four of you!"@g]

68
7165:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7272:21:50,933.3330001831055
[g@That evening Squire Kou held a feast.

69
7272:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7353:13:30,933.3330001831055
Everybody in the town was invited.@g]

70
7353:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7479:03:30,933.3330001831055
The travelers sat with the squire and his wife, Lady Kou.

71
7479:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7628:10:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie drooled as he gazed at all of the wonderful food on the table.

72
7628:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7880:13:30,933.3330001831055
"Noodles, buns, mushrooms . . . I don't know what to eat first!"

73
7880:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8016:35:10,933.3330001831055
As they ate, Squire Kou leaned toward the Tang Monk.

74
8016:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8116:48:30,933.3330001831055
"So where are you and your companions going?"

75
8116:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8213:31:50,933.3330001831055
"We're traveling to the Western Paradise," said the monk.

76
8213:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8318:20:10,933.3330001831055
"We're going to fetch the True Scriptures from Buddha."

77
8318:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8394:58:30,933.3330001831055
The squire's eyes lit up.

78
8395:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8463:31:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"You are special guests!
