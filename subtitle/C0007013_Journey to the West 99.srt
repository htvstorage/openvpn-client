1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:15,621
The monster yelled from inside the cave.

2
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:17,594
"We ate the Tang Monk!

3
00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:20,889
So you might as well leave!"

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:27,787
"Oh no!" Bajie fell to his knees and cried.

5
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:30,695
Wujing wiped tears from his eyes.

6
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:33,358
"Poor Master."

7
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,055
Wukong frowned at his companions.

8
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:39,627
"I can't believe you two believe that monster."

9
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:43,817
He sighed. "Wait here."

10
00:00:43,818 --> 00:00:48,305
The monkey turned into a moth and flew into the cave.

11
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:52,311
He soon found the Tang Monk tied up in a dark room.

12
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:55,704
Wukong turned back into himself.

13
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:58,445
"Wukong!" cried the Tang Monk.

14
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:03,233
"Shh." The monkey untied the monk.

15
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:06,027
"We must be quiet."

16
00:01:06,028 --> 00:01:10,931
Wukong recited a spell.

17
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:17,379
A moment later the sound of snoring drifted into the room.

18
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,956
"My spell put the monster and demons to sleep," said the monkey.

19
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,325
"Let's go."

20
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:29,826
Wukong and the monk came out of the cave.

21
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:32,428
Bajie and Wujing were thrilled.

22
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:37,133
"Master, we thought you'd been eaten," said Bajie.

23
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:40,231
"I knew he was fine," said Wukong.

24
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:45,235
"Now I'm going to make sure these villains never bother anyone again."

25
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:49,885
He pulled out his iron bar.

26
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:54,229
It grew until it was the size of a very tall tree.

27
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:00,934
"Stand back," said the monkey.

28
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:06,056
With one swing Wukong smashed the entire cave.

29
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:10,683
Rocks exploded and fell on top of one another.

30
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:15,814
Wukong looked at the rubble and smiled.

31
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:20,541
Weeks went by, and the travelers arrived in a small town.

32
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:23,830
Bajie's stomach growled loudly.

33
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:25,793
Wukong laughed.

34
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:28,704
"I guess we should look for food."

35
00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:33,672
They saw an old monk walking down a street.

36
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:36,072
"Kind monk," said the Tang Monk.

37
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,624
"Do you know where we can beg for some food?

38
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,617
We are quite hungry."

39
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,556
The old monk nodded.

40
00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:45,649
"Go to Squire Kou's house.

41
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,825
The squire made a vow to feed ten thousand Buddhist monks.

42
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:54,379
He will surely give you some food."

43
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,925
He gave the Tang Monk directions to the house.

44
00:02:57,926 --> 00:03:01,430
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

45
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:07,296
The travelers arrived at the squire's gate, and a servant let them in.

46
00:03:07,297 --> 00:03:11,564
The squire's house was very large and fancy.

47
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,422
Squire Kou came outside.

48
00:03:14,423 --> 00:03:17,518
"Greetings," he said with a smile.

49
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,070
"Please come inside."

50
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:23,925
The travelers sat with the squire in a large room.

51
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:27,230
A servant brought tea and snacks.

52
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:30,903
"Thank you for inviting us in, Squire," said the Tang Monk.

53
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:34,700
"We heard that you made a vow to feed ten thousand monks."

54
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:36,817
"Yes," said the squire.

55
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:40,011
"I've made plenty of money during my life.

56
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,014
But I want to do good deeds as well.

57
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:48,252
I hope to be reborn one day as a bodhisattva or even a buddha."

58
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:53,395
"Well, Squire," said Bajie, "today's your lucky day!

59
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:57,624
I can easily eat as much food as ten thousand monks.

60
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:02,061
So if you feed me, you'll definitely become a buddha!"

61
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:05,150
Everybody laughed.

62
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:08,750
"It is my lucky day," said the squire.

63
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:12,807
"Last night I checked to see how many monks I've fed.

64
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:18,046
So far I've fed 9,996 monks.

65
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,265
I need to feed only four more in order to fulfill my vow."

66
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:25,455
A smile spread across his face.

67
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:28,903
"And there are four of you!"

68
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:32,738
That evening Squire Kou held a feast.

69
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,649
Everybody in the town was invited.

70
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,179
The travelers sat with the squire and his wife, Lady Kou.

71
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,547
Bajie drooled as he gazed at all of the wonderful food on the table.

72
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:54,621
"Noodles, buns, mushrooms . . . I don't know what to eat first!"

73
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:59,530
As they ate, Squire Kou leaned toward the Tang Monk.

74
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:03,138
"So where are you and your companions going?"

75
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:06,620
"We're traveling to the Western Paradise," said the monk.

76
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:10,393
"We're going to fetch the True Scriptures from Buddha."

77
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,152
The squire's eyes lit up.

78
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:15,620
"You are special guests!

79
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:20,322
I can't let you leave!"
