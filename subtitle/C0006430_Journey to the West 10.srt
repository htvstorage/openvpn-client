1
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:16,862
"How will we defeat Sun Wukong?" moaned the Jade Emperor.

2
00:00:16,863 --> 00:00:21,150
"I sent our entire army, and they couldn't arrest him!"

3
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:27,496
"Perhaps we can ask the sage Erlang to capture him," said Guanyin.

4
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:33,535
"Yes," said the Jade Emperor. "Erlang is very powerful."

5
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,928
He turned back to the messenger.

6
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:37,906
"Go to Plum Mountain.

7
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:43,963
Ask Erlang if he'll help us."

8
00:00:43,964 --> 00:00:50,547
Wukong stood in front of the waterfall with his cheering subjects.

9
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:56,440
"Our king has just defeated an entire army from Heaven!" said the gibbon.

10
00:00:56,441 --> 00:01:00,534
"I hope the Jade Emperor learned his lesson," said Wukong.

11
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,912
"He and his army are no match forâ€”"

12
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:07,687
"Sun Wukong!" a deep voice boomed.

13
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:10,048
Wukong looked up.

14
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,931
A large man was coming down from the sky.

15
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:20,258
The apes and other monkeys ran and hid.

16
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:23,220
"I am Erlang," said the man.

17
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:27,023
"The Jade Emperor sent me to arrest you."

18
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:33,392
Wukong laughed. "The Jade Emperor's entire army couldn't defeat me.

19
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,998
What do you think you're going to do?"

20
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:39,937
"I am going to take you back to Heaven," said Erlang.

21
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:43,235
"And you will be punished!"

22
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:49,492
Waving his iron bar, Wukong leaped at Erlang.

23
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:55,312
Clang! Erlang blocked the bar with his sword and then struck back.

24
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:59,604
Wukong jumped onto a cloud to get out of the way.

25
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:04,516
Erlang leaped into the air.

26
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:08,408
He shook his body and suddenly grew much bigger.

27
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:13,566
Wukong laughed. "I can do that too!"

28
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:22,654
He shook his body and grew just as big as Erlang.

29
00:02:22,655 --> 00:02:27,896
Clouds swirled and wind blew as the two giants fought in the sky.

30
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,802
Their weapons banged together all through the night.

31
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:36,631
They were still fighting when the sun rose the next morning.

32
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:40,463
"This fight could last forever," thought Wukong.

33
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:43,237
"I should try a different plan."

34
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:52,034
Wukong struck at Erlang one last time and then jumped back down to Earth.

35
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:56,716
He turned himself into a sparrow and perched on a branch.

36
00:02:56,717 --> 00:03:00,790
"Erlang will never find me now," thought Wukong.

37
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,405
He looked up and saw a hawk.

38
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:06,020
The hawk swooped toward him.

39
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:10,183
"Oh no!" thought Wukong. "That's Erlang!"

40
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:14,294
Wukong dived into a stream.

41
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:18,983
He turned himself into a fish and swam in the water.

42
00:03:18,984 --> 00:03:23,270
But then a crane flew over the stream.

43
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:25,905
The crane swooped down at the water.

44
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,358
Its mouth was wide open.

45
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:31,736
Wukong shot out of the stream.

46
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:37,083
He changed back into himself and ran down a hill.

47
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:40,319
"I'll turn myself into a temple," he thought.

48
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:48,176
"Then, if Erlang tries to enter, I'll bite him!"

49
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:53,693
Wukong's eyes became windows, and his mouth became a door.

50
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:57,178
He turned his tail into a flagpole.

51
00:03:57,179 --> 00:04:01,052
A moment later Erlang came down the hill.

52
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:04,684
When he saw the temple, he scratched his head.

53
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:07,117
"Hmm," said Erlang.

54
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:10,604
"I never saw a temple with a flagpole before.

55
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:13,071
This must be Wukong.

56
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:15,856
I'll kick in that door."

57
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:20,595
"Oh no!" thought Wukong. "He'll break all my teeth!"

58
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:25,370
Wukong changed back into himself and ran.

59
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:30,239
Erlang was right behind him.

60
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,081
Up in Heaven the Jade Emperor, the queen, and Guanyin watched the chase.

61
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:40,930
The sage Laozi came over to them.

62
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:44,510
"What's going on?" he asked, looking down.

63
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:50,431
"That monkey, Sun Wukong, ate all the peaches from the garden," said the Jade Emperor.

64
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:53,320
"Then he defeated our entire army.

65
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:56,775
Erlang is trying to catch him now."

66
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:59,653
"I can help," said Laozi.

67
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:04,326
He took a metal ring off his arm.

68
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:12,726
He aimed carefully and hurled it down to Earth.

69
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:16,221
Clunk! The ring hit Wukong on the head.

70
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:23,906
The monkey looked dizzy for a moment and then fell to the ground.
