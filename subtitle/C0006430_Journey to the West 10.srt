"How will we defeat Sun Wukong?" moaned the Jade Emperor.

161:26:51,050.66700005531311 --> 280:31:51,050.66700005531311
"I sent our entire army, and they couldn't arrest him!"

280:33:31,050.66700005531311 --> 456:48:31,050.66700005531311
"Perhaps we can ask the sage Erlang to capture him," said Guanyin.

456:50:11,050.66700005531311 --> 624:33:31,050.66699981689453
"Yes," said the Jade Emperor. "Erlang is very powerful."

624:35:11,050.66699981689453 --> 691:01:51,050.66699981689453
He turned back to the messenger.

914:15:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1097:06:51,050.66699981689453
Wukong stood in front of the waterfall with his cheering subjects.

9
1097:08:31,050.66699981689453 --> 1260:48:31,050.66699981689453
"Our king has just defeated an entire army from Heaven!" said the gibbon.

10
1260:50:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1374:31:51,050.66699981689453
"I hope the Jade Emperor learned his lesson," said Wukong.

11
1374:33:31,050.66699981689453 --> 1440:35:11,050.66699981689453

"Sun Wukong!" a deep voice boomed.

13
1573:15:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1638:48:31,050.66699981689453

1638:50:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1746:40:11,050.66699981689453
A large man was coming down from the sky.@g]

1746:41:51,050.66699981689453 --> 1922:25:11,050.66699981689453
The apes and other monkeys ran and hid.

16
1922:26:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2004:41:51,050.66699981689453
[g@"I am Erlang," said the man.

2004:43:31,050.66699981689453 --> 2110:20:11,050.66699981689453

2110:21:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2287:15:11,050.66699981689453
Wukong laughed. "The Jade Emperor's entire army couldn't defeat me.

19
2287:16:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2359:38:31,050.66699981689453
What do you think you're going to do?"

20
2359:40:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2469:03:31,050.66699981689453
"I am going to take you back to Heaven," said Erlang.

21
2469:05:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2560:40:11,050.66699981689453
"And you will be punished!"

2560:41:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2734:28:31,050.66699981689453
Waving his iron bar, Wukong leaped at Erlang.

23
2734:30:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2896:08:31,050.66699981689453
[i@Clang!@i] Erlang blocked the bar with his sword and then struck back.

2896:10:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3015:21:51,050.66699981689453
Wukong jumped onto a cloud to get out of the way.

25
3015:23:31,050.66699981689453 --> 3151:48:31,050.66699981689453
Erlang leaped into the air.

26
3151:50:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3259:55:11,050.66699981689453
He shook his body and suddenly grew much bigger.

27
3259:56:51,050.66699981689453 --> 3403:11:51,050.66699981689453
Wukong laughed. "I can do that too!"

28
3403:13:31,050.66699981689453 --> 3655:38:31,050.66699981689453
He shook his body and grew just as big as Erlang.

29
3655:40:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3801:15:11,050.66699981689453
Clouds swirled and wind blew as the two giants fought in the sky.

30
3801:16:51,050.66699981689453 --> 3909:45:11,050.66699981689453
Their weapons banged together all through the night.

31
3909:46:51,050.66699981689453 --> 4043:53:31,050.66699981689453
They were still fighting when the sun rose the next morning.

32
4043:55:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4150:20:11,050.66699981689453
"This fight could last forever," thought Wukong.

33
4150:21:51,050.66699981689453 --> 4227:23:31,050.66699981689453
"I should try a different plan."

34
4227:25:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4471:45:11,050.66699981689453
Wukong struck at Erlang one last time and then jumped back down to Earth.

35
4471:46:51,050.66699981689453 --> 4601:48:31,050.66699981689453
He turned himself into a sparrow and perched on a branch.

36
4601:50:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4714:58:31,050.66699981689453
"Erlang will never find me now," thought Wukong.

37
4715:00:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4787:36:51,050.66699981689453

4787:38:31,050.66699981689453 --> 4860:15:11,050.66699981689453
The hawk swooped toward him.@g]

4860:16:51,050.66699981689453 --> 4975:53:31,050.66699981689453
"Oh no!" thought Wukong. "That's Erlang!"

40
4975:55:11,050.66699981689453 --> 5090:05:11,050.66699981689453
Wukong dived into a stream.

41
5090:06:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5220:20:11,050.66699981689453
He turned himself into a fish and swam in the water.

42
5220:21:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5339:25:11,050.66699981689453
But then a crane flew over the stream.

43
5339:26:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5412:36:51,050.66699981689453
[g@The crane swooped down at the water.

5412:38:31,050.66699981689453 --> 5480:45:11,050.66699981689453
Its mouth was wide open.@g]

5480:46:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5574:35:11,050.66699981689453
Wukong shot out of the stream.

46
5574:36:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5723:06:51,050.66699981689453
He changed back into himself and ran down a hill.

47
5723:08:31,050.66699981689453 --> 5813:00:11,050.66699981689453
"I'll turn myself into a temple," he thought.

48
5813:01:51,050.66699981689453 --> 6031:15:11,050.66699981689453
"Then, if Erlang tries to enter, I'll bite him!"

49
6031:16:51,050.66699981689453 --> 6184:30:11,050.66699981689453
Wukong's eyes became windows, and his mouth became a door.

50
6184:31:51,050.66699981689453 --> 6281:18:31,050.66699981689453
He turned his tail into a flagpole.

51
6281:20:11,050.66699981689453 --> 6388:55:11,050.66699981689453
A moment later Erlang came down the hill.

52
6388:56:51,050.66699981689453 --> 6489:48:31,050.66699981689453
When he saw the temple, he scratched his head.

53
6489:50:11,050.66699981689453 --> 6557:23:31,050.66699981689453

"Oh no!" thought Wukong. "He'll break all my teeth!"

6931:48:31,050.66699981689453 --> 7064:25:11,050.66699981689453

Up in Heaven the Jade Emperor, the queen, and Guanyin watched the chase.

7389:45:11,050.66699981689453 --> 7496:38:31,050.66699981689453

"What's going on?" he asked, looking down.

7596:06:51,050.66699981689453 --> 7760:33:31,050.66699981689453

"I can help," said Laozi.

8016:45:11,050.66699981689453 --> 8146:31:51,050.66699981689453
He took a metal ring off his arm.

8146:33:31,050.66699981689453 --> 8379:51:51,050.66699981689453
He aimed carefully and hurled it down to Earth.

69
8379:53:31,050.66699981689453 --> 8476:56:51,050.66699981689453

The monkey looked dizzy for a moment and then fell to the ground.
