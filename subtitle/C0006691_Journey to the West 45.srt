1
00:00:11,000 --> 161:25:11,000
The Tang Monk introduced himself to the prince [n@and then waved toward the others.

2
161:26:51,000 --> 231:53:31,000
"These are my companions.

3
231:55:11,000 --> 331:50:11,000
We're going to the Western Paradise to get scriptures from Buddha."

4
331:51:51,000 --> 401:43:31,000
[g@"What's going on?" asked the prince.

5
401:45:11,000 --> 481:26:51,000
"Why did the monkey lead me here?"@g]

6
481:28:31,000 --> 678:26:51,000
"The man ruling the Black Rooster Kingdom [n@is not really the king," said the monk.

7
678:28:31,000 --> 748:33:31,000
He told the prince everything.

8
748:35:11,000 --> 873:58:31,000
When the Tang Monk's story was finished, the prince was furious.

9
874:00:11,000 --> 1017:11:51,000
"You're lying! I will have you arrested for making up such a story!"

10
1017:13:31,000 --> 1095:18:31,000
[g@The Tang Monk reached into his robe.

11
1095:20:11,000 --> 1181:53:31,000
He pulled out the jade coin.@g]

12
1181:55:11,000 --> 1270:30:11,000
"Your father told me to show you this."

13
1270:31:51,000 --> 1318:23:31,000
[g@The prince gasped.

14
1318:25:11,000 --> 1383:41:51,000
"That coin belongs to my father!@g]

15
1383:43:31,000 --> 1455:01:51,000
[g@It's a royal treasure."

16
1455:03:31,000 --> 1577:35:11,000
He began to cry.

17
1577:36:51,000 --> 1633:45:11,000
"Your story must be true.@g]

18
1633:46:51,000 --> 1690:31:51,000
[g@My poor father.

19
1690:33:31,000 --> 1817:06:51,000
All this time, people thought that evil Daoist was him."@g]

20
1817:08:31,000 --> 1888:15:11,000
[g@"Don't worry," said Wukong.

21
1888:16:51,000 --> 2011:05:11,000
"We'll get rid of that fake king."@g]

22
2011:06:51,000 --> 2111:46:51,000
Late that night Wukong lay awake.

23
2111:48:31,000 --> 2216:00:11,000
"The Daoist will deny everything," he thought.

24
2216:01:51,000 --> 2318:50:11,000
"We need proof that he killed the real king."

25
2318:51:51,000 --> 2399:15:11,000
[g@He poked Bajie, who was fast asleep.

26
2399:16:51,000 --> 2467:51:51,000
"Bajie, wake up."@g]

27
2467:53:31,000 --> 2522:53:31,000
[g@The pig rolled over.

28
2522:55:11,000 --> 2653:55:11,000
"Leave me alone . . . sleeping."@g]

29
2653:56:51,000 --> 2741:46:51,000
"We need to do something," said Wukong.

30
2741:48:31,000 --> 2876:48:31,000
"Not now," mumbled Bajie.

31
2876:50:11,000 --> 2964:15:11,000
"I know where there's treasure," the monkey lied.

32
2964:16:51,000 --> 3045:53:31,000
[g@Bajie's eyes popped open.

33
3045:55:11,000 --> 3109:58:31,000
"Where is the treasure?"@g]

34
3110:00:11,000 --> 3217:20:11,000
"Follow me," said Wukong.

35
3217:21:51,000 --> 3358:26:51,000
They went outside and flew to the palace.

36
3358:28:31,000 --> 3496:21:51,000
In a small courtyard, Wukong rushed toward a well.

37
3496:23:31,000 --> 3548:13:31,000
[g@"The treasure is in this well,"

38
3548:15:11,000 --> 3643:11:51,000
said the monkey, pulling the lid off.@g]

39
3643:13:31,000 --> 3762:40:11,000
Bajie peered down into the darkness.

40
3762:41:51,000 --> 3850:03:31,000
"Is this the well the king was pushed into?"

41
3850:05:11,000 --> 3890:41:51,000
[g@"Oh, I'm not sure,"

42
3890:43:31,000 --> 3970:55:11,000
said Wukong, pretending to not know.@g]

43
3970:56:51,000 --> 4076:11:51,000
"The treasure is definitely down there though."

44
4076:13:31,000 --> 4195:23:31,000
"How will we get it out?" asked the pig.

45
4195:25:11,000 --> 4361:43:31,000
Wukong pushed Bajie, and the pig splashed into the water.

46
4361:45:11,000 --> 4451:36:51,000
"You rotten monkey!" shouted Bajie.

47
4451:38:31,000 --> 4517:45:11,000
[g@The monkey laughed.

48
4517:46:51,000 --> 4602:51:51,000
"Find the treasure, and I'll let you back up."@g]

49
4602:53:31,000 --> 4909:36:51,000
Angry, Bajie dived down, deeper and deeper, until he arrived at a palace.

50
4909:38:31,000 --> 4996:38:31,000
[g@"Greetings," said a dragon.

51
4996:40:11,000 --> 5117:08:31,000
"I'm the Well Dragon King."@g]

52
5117:10:11,000 --> 5197:50:11,000
[g@"My name is Zhu Bajie," said the pig.

53
5197:51:51,000 --> 5254:11:51,000
"I'm here for treasure."@g]

54
5254:13:31,000 --> 5375:40:11,000
"I don't have any treasure for you," said the dragon.

55
5375:41:51,000 --> 5468:16:51,000
[g@He looked up.

56
5468:18:31,000 --> 5536:58:31,000
"You came from the well.@g]

57
5537:00:11,000 --> 5646:30:11,000
Are you from the Black Rooster Kingdom?"

58
5646:31:51,000 --> 5718:43:31,000
"Not exactly," said Bajie.

59
5718:45:11,000 --> 5841:58:31,000
"My friends and I are helping the king of the Black Rooster Kingdom."

60
5842:00:11,000 --> 5955:03:31,000
"Oh, really?" The dragon raised his eyebrows.

61
5955:05:11,000 --> 6217:03:31,000
"I have something for you. Follow me."

62
6217:05:11,000 --> 6386:51:51,000
The Well Dragon King led Bajie into a room.

63
6386:53:31,000 --> 6428:13:31,000
[g@The pig gasped.

64
6428:15:11,000 --> 6520:56:51,000
The body of a man lay on a table.@g]

65
6520:58:31,000 --> 6661:53:31,000
"This is the Black Rooster King's body," said the dragon.

66
6661:55:11,000 --> 6752:16:51,000
"Please take it back with you."

67
6752:18:31,000 --> 6902:36:51,000
Bajie was furious that Wukong had tricked him.

68
6902:38:31,000 --> 7016:21:51,000
He lifted the king's body and headed back to the well.

69
7016:23:31,000 --> 7169:43:31,000
"I will get revenge later," he said to himself.

70
7169:45:11,000 --> 7285:43:31,000
The next morning the Tang Monk looked at the king's body.

71
7285:45:11,000 --> 7369:56:51,000
"I wish we could bring him back to life."

72
7369:58:31,000 --> 7495:45:11,000
"Wukong can bring him back to life," said Bajie suddenly.

73
7495:46:51,000 --> 7563:45:11,000
"What!" cried the monkey.

74
7563:46:51,000 --> 7629:00:11,000
The Tang Monk smiled.

75
7629:01:51,000 --> 7682:18:31,000
[g@"That's wonderful, Wukong.

76
7682:20:11,000 --> 7766:21:51,000
Please bring him back to life right away."@g]

77
7766:23:31,000 --> 7854:16:51,000
Bajie giggled.

78
7854:18:31,000 --> 7952:33:31,000
"I don't know how to do that!" said the monkey.

79
7952:35:11,000 --> 8051:18:31,000
"Don't believe him, Master," said Bajie.

80
8051:20:11,000 --> 8113:23:31,000
[g@"He can bring the king back to life.

81
8113:25:11,000 --> 8183:50:11,000
He just doesn't want to."@g]

82
8183:51:51,000 --> 8280:01:51,000
"That's not true!" protested Wukong.

83
8280:03:31,000 --> 8373:35:11,000
[g@"He's lying, Master," said Bajie.

84
8373:36:51,000 --> 8627:03:31,000
"Use the Tight Headband spell!"@g]
