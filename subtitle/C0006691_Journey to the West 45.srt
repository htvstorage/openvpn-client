1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,811
The Tang Monk introduced himself to the prince [n@and then waved toward the others.

2
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:19,348
"These are my companions.

3
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:22,946
We're going to the Western Paradise to get scriptures from Buddha."

4
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:25,462
[g@"What's going on?" asked the prince.

5
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:28,332
"Why did the monkey lead me here?"@g]

6
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:35,424
"The man ruling the Black Rooster Kingdom [n@is not really the king," said the monk.

7
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:37,948
He told the prince everything.

8
00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:42,463
When the Tang Monk's story was finished, the prince was furious.

9
00:00:42,464 --> 00:00:47,619
"You're lying! I will have you arrested for making up such a story!"

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,431
[g@The Tang Monk reached into his robe.

11
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,548
He pulled out the jade coin.@g]

12
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:56,738
"Your father told me to show you this."

13
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:58,462
[g@The prince gasped.

14
00:00:58,463 --> 00:01:00,813
"That coin belongs to my father!@g]

15
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:03,381
[g@It's a royal treasure."

16
00:01:03,382 --> 00:01:07,793
He began to cry.

17
00:01:07,794 --> 00:01:09,815
"Your story must be true.@g]

18
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:11,859
[g@My poor father.

19
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,416
All this time, people thought that evil Daoist was him."@g]

20
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:18,977
[g@"Don't worry," said Wukong.

21
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:23,399
"We'll get rid of that fake king."@g]

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,024
Late that night Wukong lay awake.

23
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:30,776
"The Daoist will deny everything," he thought.

24
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:34,478
"We need proof that he killed the real king."

25
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,373
[g@He poked Bajie, who was fast asleep.

26
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:39,843
"Bajie, wake up."@g]

27
00:01:39,844 --> 00:01:41,824
[g@The pig rolled over.

28
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:46,541
"Leave me alone . . . sleeping."@g]

29
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:49,704
"We need to do something," said Wukong.

30
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:54,565
"Not now," mumbled Bajie.

31
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:57,713
"I know where there's treasure," the monkey lied.

32
00:01:57,714 --> 00:02:00,652
[g@Bajie's eyes popped open.

33
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,959
"Where is the treasure?"@g]

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,824
"Follow me," said Wukong.

35
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:11,904
They went outside and flew to the palace.

36
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:16,869
In a small courtyard, Wukong rushed toward a well.

37
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,736
[g@"The treasure is in this well,"

38
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:22,155
said the monkey, pulling the lid off.@g]

39
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:26,456
Bajie peered down into the darkness.

40
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:29,602
"Is this the well the king was pushed into?"

41
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:31,065
[g@"Oh, I'm not sure,"

42
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,953
said Wukong, pretending to not know.@g]

43
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:37,743
"The treasure is definitely down there though."

44
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:42,034
"How will we get it out?" asked the pig.

45
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:48,022
Wukong pushed Bajie, and the pig splashed into the water.

46
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:51,258
"You rotten monkey!" shouted Bajie.

47
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:53,639
[g@The monkey laughed.

48
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,703
"Find the treasure, and I'll let you back up."@g]

49
00:02:56,704 --> 00:03:07,746
Angry, Bajie dived down, deeper and deeper, until he arrived at a palace.

50
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:10,879
[g@"Greetings," said a dragon.

51
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,217
"I'm the Well Dragon King."@g]

52
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:18,122
[g@"My name is Zhu Bajie," said the pig.

53
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:20,151
"I'm here for treasure."@g]

54
00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:24,524
"I don't have any treasure for you," said the dragon.

55
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:27,858
[g@He looked up.

56
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:30,331
"You came from the well.@g]

57
00:03:30,332 --> 00:03:34,274
Are you from the Black Rooster Kingdom?"

58
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:36,874
"Not exactly," said Bajie.

59
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:41,311
"My friends and I are helping the king of the Black Rooster Kingdom."

60
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:45,382
"Oh, really?" The dragon raised his eyebrows.

61
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:54,814
"I have something for you. Follow me."

62
00:03:54,815 --> 00:04:00,927
The Well Dragon King led Bajie into a room.

63
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:02,416
[g@The pig gasped.

64
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:05,754
The body of a man lay on a table.@g]

65
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:10,828
"This is the Black Rooster King's body," said the dragon.

66
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:14,082
"Please take it back with you."

67
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:19,494
Bajie was furious that Wukong had tricked him.

68
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:23,589
He lifted the king's body and headed back to the well.

69
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:29,110
"I will get revenge later," he said to himself.

70
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:33,286
The next morning the Tang Monk looked at the king's body.

71
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:36,318
"I wish we could bring him back to life."

72
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,847
"Wukong can bring him back to life," said Bajie suddenly.

73
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:43,295
"What!" cried the monkey.

74
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:45,644
The Tang Monk smiled.

75
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:47,563
[g@"That's wonderful, Wukong.

76
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:50,589
Please bring him back to life right away."@g]

77
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,754
Bajie giggled.

78
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:57,292
"I don't know how to do that!" said the monkey.

79
00:04:57,293 --> 00:05:00,847
"Don't believe him, Master," said Bajie.

80
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:03,082
[g@"He can bring the king back to life.

81
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,618
He just doesn't want to."@g]

82
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:09,081
"That's not true!" protested Wukong.

83
00:05:09,082 --> 00:05:12,449
[g@"He's lying, Master," said Bajie.

84
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:21,574
"Use the Tight Headband spell!"@g]
