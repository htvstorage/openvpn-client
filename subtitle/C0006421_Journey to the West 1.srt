00:10:11,114.66700000001583 --> 310:35:11,114.66700005531311
From the beginning of time, a rock had sat high on top of a mountain.

2
310:36:51,114.66700005531311 --> 488:38:31,114.66700005531311
The sun, the moon, Heaven, and Earth all worked their magic on the rock.

3
488:40:11,114.66700005531311 --> 612:05:11,114.66699981689453
[g@One day the rock split open.

4
612:06:51,114.66699981689453 --> 765:23:31,114.66699981689453
Inside was a monkey.@g]

5
765:25:11,114.66699981689453 --> 933:40:11,114.66699981689453
The monkey stood up and stretched.

6
933:41:51,114.66699981689453 --> 1131:26:51,114.66699981689453
Suddenly powerful light shot from his eyes.

7
1131:28:31,114.66699981689453 --> 1269:05:11,114.66699981689453
For a moment the light reached the Cloud Palace in Heaven.

8
1269:06:51,114.66699981689453 --> 1367:30:11,114.66699981689453
The Jade Emperor, ruler of Heaven, sat up.

9
1367:31:51,114.66699981689453 --> 1495:11:51,114.66699981689453
He turned to one of his captains, who was standing nearby.

10
1495:13:31,114.66699981689453 --> 1594:51:51,114.66699981689453
"Find out what caused that light," said the emperor.

11
1594:53:31,114.66699981689453 --> 1708:00:11,114.66699981689453
"Yes, Your Majesty," said the captain.

12
1708:01:51,114.66699981689453 --> 1816:58:31,114.66699981689453
The captain rushed out of the hall.

13
1817:00:11,114.66699981689453 --> 1959:26:51,114.66699981689453
He looked out the southern gate of Heaven [n@and saw the monkey on Earth below.

14
1959:28:31,114.66699981689453 --> 2009:30:11,114.66699981689453
[g@The light was gone.

15
2009:31:51,114.66699981689453 --> 2089:13:31,114.66699981689453
But the captain had magical sight.@g]

16
2089:15:11,114.66699981689453 --> 2190:05:11,114.66699981689453
He could see everything that had just happened.

17
2190:06:51,114.66699981689453 --> 2317:15:11,114.66699981689453
"Interesting," said the captain.

18
2317:16:51,114.66699981689453 --> 2426:30:11,114.66699981689453
"Well?" said the Jade Emperor when the captain returned.

19
2426:31:51,114.66699981689453 --> 2502:00:11,114.66699981689453
"What caused the light?"

20
2502:01:51,114.66699981689453 --> 2580:53:31,114.66699981689453
"It was a monkey," said the captain.

21
2580:55:11,114.66699981689453 --> 2665:40:11,114.66699981689453
"A monkey?" asked the Jade Emperor.

22
2665:41:51,114.66699981689453 --> 2723:51:51,114.66699981689453
"Yes," said the captain.

23
2723:53:31,114.66699981689453 --> 2820:56:51,114.66699981689453
"He's on the Fruit and Flower Mountain, down on Earth.

24
2820:58:31,114.66699981689453 --> 2911:46:51,114.66699981689453
[g@There had been a rock on the mountain.

25
2911:48:31,114.66699981689453 --> 2975:20:11,114.66699981689453
The monkey came from the rock.@g]

26
2975:21:51,114.66699981689453 --> 3110:28:31,114.66699981689453
The light shone from the monkey's eyes."

27
3110:30:11,114.66699981689453 --> 3226:16:51,114.66699981689453
The emperor thought for a moment and then shrugged.

28
3226:18:31,114.66699981689453 --> 3317:48:31,114.66699981689453
"I'm not surprised," he said.

29
3317:50:11,114.66699981689453 --> 3776:06:51,114.66699981689453
"Amazing things happen when Heaven and Earth work together."

30
3776:08:31,114.66699981689453 --> 3989:35:11,114.66699981689453
As time passed, Monkey learned to walk, run, and climb.

31
3989:36:51,114.66699981689453 --> 4144:28:31,114.66699981689453
He drank from streams and ate grasses and leaves.

32
4144:30:11,114.66699981689453 --> 4374:30:11,114.66699981689453
He gathered fruit and explored caves and mountaintops.

33
4374:31:51,114.66699981689453 --> 4496:50:11,114.66699981689453
He became friends with all the other monkeys and apes.

34
4496:51:51,114.66699981689453 --> 4605:10:11,114.66699981689453
At night he slept under a cliff.

35
4605:11:51,114.66699981689453 --> 4775:38:31,114.66699981689453
One very hot morning, all the monkeys and apes were playing in the shade.

36
4775:40:11,114.66699981689453 --> 4913:56:51,114.66699981689453
[g@"It is so hot today!" cried one monkey.

37
4913:58:31,114.66699981689453 --> 4983:35:11,114.66699981689453
"Let's play in the stream."@g]

38
4983:36:51,114.66699981689453 --> 5058:53:31,114.66699981689453
"Good idea!" said another monkey.

39
5058:55:11,114.66699981689453 --> 5140:43:31,114.66699981689453
The monkeys and apes ran to the stream.

40
5140:45:11,114.66699981689453 --> 5269:23:31,114.66699981689453
The water rolled and bounced over the rocks.

41
5269:25:11,114.66699981689453 --> 5389:03:31,114.66699981689453
[g@The monkeys jumped into the cool water.

42
5389:05:11,114.66699981689453 --> 5459:41:51,114.66699981689453
Everyone splashed and played.@g]

43
5459:43:31,114.66699981689453 --> 5574:51:51,114.66699981689453
After a few minutes, one monkey scratched her head.

44
5574:53:31,114.66699981689453 --> 5683:35:11,114.66699981689453
[g@"We all love this stream," she said.

45
5683:36:51,114.66699981689453 --> 5721:50:11,114.66699981689453
"We drink from it.@g]

46
5721:51:51,114.66699981689453 --> 5758:10:11,114.66699981689453
[g@We swim in it.

47
5758:11:51,114.66699981689453 --> 5856:08:31,114.66699981689453
We know that it flows all the way to the ocean.@g]

48
5856:10:11,114.66699981689453 --> 5961:53:31,114.66699981689453
But does anyone know where the stream begins?"

49
5961:55:11,114.66699981689453 --> 6086:48:31,114.66699981689453
They all looked at one another and shook their heads.

50
6086:50:11,114.66699981689453 --> 6201:51:51,114.66699981689453
"We have nothing to do today," the monkey continued.

51
6201:53:31,114.66699981689453 --> 6318:08:31,114.66699981689453
"Why don't we follow the stream to find its source?"

52
6318:10:11,114.66699981689453 --> 6411:15:11,114.66699981689453
"That sounds like fun," said another monkey.

53
6411:16:51,114.66699981689453 --> 6493:50:11,114.66699981689453
"Let's go!" said a third monkey.

54
6493:51:51,114.66699981689453 --> 6563:38:31,114.66699981689453
Everyone jumped out of the water.

55
6563:40:11,114.66699981689453 --> 6690:51:51,114.66699981689453
They ran alongside the stream and swung from tree to tree.

56
6690:53:31,114.66699981689453 --> 6805:16:51,114.66699981689453
They jumped over rocks and climbed up steep cliffs.

57
6805:18:31,114.66699981689453 --> 6962:46:51,114.66699981689453
Higher and higher they went up the mountain [n@until they reached an enormous waterfall.

58
6962:48:31,114.66699981689453 --> 7022:08:31,114.66699981689453
[g@Mist filled the air.

59
7022:10:11,114.66699981689453 --> 7188:30:11,114.66699981689453
The water crashed down, roaring like thunder.@g]

60
7188:31:51,114.66699981689453 --> 7298:50:11,114.66699981689453
"I wonder what's behind that waterfall," said one monkey.

61
7298:51:51,114.66699981689453 --> 7384:16:51,114.66699981689453
[g@"Me too," said a second monkey.

62
7384:18:31,114.66699981689453 --> 7465:16:51,114.66699981689453
"But nobody could jump through it."@g]

63
7465:18:31,114.66699981689453 --> 7602:53:31,114.66699981689453
"Whoever can jump through and come back [n@alive will be our king," said a gibbon.

64
7602:55:11,114.66699981689453 --> 7671:18:31,114.66699981689453
"Is anyone brave enough to try?"

65
7671:20:11,114.66699981689453 --> 7759:46:51,114.66699981689453
[g@All the monkeys and apes looked at one another.

66
7759:48:31,114.66699981689453 --> 7860:20:11,114.66699981689453
They shook their heads.@g]

67
7860:21:51,114.66699981689453 --> 8017:31:51,114.66699981689453
"I'm not going to try," said a tall monkey.

68
8017:33:31,114.66699981689453 --> 8100:08:31,114.66699981689453
"Me neither," said a short monkey.

69
8100:10:11,114.66699981689453 --> 8188:01:51,114.66699981689453
A voice called out, "I'll do it!"

70
8188:03:31,114.66699981689453 --> 8313:25:11,114.66699981689453
Everyone moved out of the way as the speaker stepped forward.

71
8313:26:51,114.66699981689453 --> 8373:23:31,114.66699981689453
It was Monkey.

72
8373:25:11,114.66699981689453 --> 8435:55:11,114.66699981689453
[g@"Are you sure?" asked the gibbon.

73
8435:56:51,114.66699981689453 --> 8494:00:11,114.66699981689453
"It looks dangerous."@g]

74
8494:01:51,114.66699981689453 --> 8601:38:31,114.66699981689453
Monkey laughed. "I'm not afraid of anything!

75
8601:40:11,114.66699981689453 --> 8681:00:11,114.66699981689453
And when I come back, I will be king!"

76
8681:18:31,114.66699981689453 --> 8902:00:11,114.66699981689453
Monkey took a deep breath and leaped into the waterfall.
