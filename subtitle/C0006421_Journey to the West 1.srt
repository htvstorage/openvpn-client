1
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:22,296
From the beginning of time, a rock had sat high on top of a mountain.

2
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:28,706
The sun, the moon, Heaven, and Earth all worked their magic on the rock.

3
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:33,150
[g@One day the rock split open.

4
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:38,669
Inside was a monkey.@g]

5
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,727
The monkey stood up and stretched.

6
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:51,847
Suddenly powerful light shot from his eyes.

7
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:56,802
For a moment the light reached the Cloud Palace in Heaven.

8
00:00:56,803 --> 00:01:00,345
The Jade Emperor, ruler of Heaven, sat up.

9
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:04,942
He turned to one of his captains, who was standing nearby.

10
00:01:04,943 --> 00:01:08,530
"Find out what caused that light," said the emperor.

11
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:12,603
"Yes, Your Majesty," said the captain.

12
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:16,526
The captain rushed out of the hall.

13
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:21,655
He looked out the southern gate of Heaven [n@and saw the monkey on Earth below.

14
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:23,457
[g@The light was gone.

15
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,327
But the captain had magical sight.@g]

16
00:01:26,328 --> 00:01:29,958
He could see everything that had just happened.

17
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,536
"Interesting," said the captain.

18
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:38,469
"Well?" said the Jade Emperor when the captain returned.

19
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,187
"What caused the light?"

20
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:44,027
"It was a monkey," said the captain.

21
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:47,079
"A monkey?" asked the Jade Emperor.

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,174
"Yes," said the captain.

23
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,669
"He's on the Fruit and Flower Mountain, down on Earth.

24
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,939
[g@There had been a rock on the mountain.

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,227
The monkey came from the rock.@g]

26
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:03,092
The light shone from the monkey's eyes."

27
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:07,261
The emperor thought for a moment and then shrugged.

28
00:02:07,262 --> 00:02:10,556
"I'm not surprised," he said.

29
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:27,055
"Amazing things happen when Heaven and Earth work together."

30
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:34,740
As time passed, Monkey learned to walk, run, and climb.

31
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:40,316
He drank from streams and ate grasses and leaves.

32
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:48,597
He gathered fruit and explored caves and mountaintops.

33
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,001
He became friends with all the other monkeys and apes.

34
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:56,901
At night he slept under a cliff.

35
00:02:56,902 --> 00:03:03,038
One very hot morning, all the monkeys and apes were playing in the shade.

36
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,017
[g@"It is so hot today!" cried one monkey.

37
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:10,524
"Let's play in the stream."@g]

38
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:13,235
"Good idea!" said another monkey.

39
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:16,181
The monkeys and apes ran to the stream.

40
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:20,813
The water rolled and bounced over the rocks.

41
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:25,121
[g@The monkeys jumped into the cool water.

42
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,664
Everyone splashed and played.@g]

43
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:31,810
After a few minutes, one monkey scratched her head.

44
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,724
[g@"We all love this stream," she said.

45
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:37,101
"We drink from it.@g]

46
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:38,409
[g@We swim in it.

47
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,936
We know that it flows all the way to the ocean.@g]

48
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:45,743
But does anyone know where the stream begins?"

49
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:50,240
They all looked at one another and shook their heads.

50
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:54,382
"We have nothing to do today," the monkey continued.

51
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:58,568
"Why don't we follow the stream to find its source?"

52
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,920
"That sounds like fun," said another monkey.

53
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:04,893
"Let's go!" said a third monkey.

54
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:07,406
Everyone jumped out of the water.

55
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:11,986
They ran alongside the stream and swung from tree to tree.

56
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:16,105
They jumped over rocks and climbed up steep cliffs.

57
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:21,775
Higher and higher they went up the mountain [n@until they reached an enormous waterfall.

58
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,912
[g@Mist filled the air.

59
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:29,901
The water crashed down, roaring like thunder.@g]

60
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:33,873
"I wonder what's behind that waterfall," said one monkey.

61
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,949
[g@"Me too," said a second monkey.

62
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,865
"But nobody could jump through it."@g]

63
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:44,819
"Whoever can jump through and come back [n@alive will be our king," said a gibbon.

64
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,282
"Is anyone brave enough to try?"

65
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:50,467
[g@All the monkeys and apes looked at one another.

66
00:04:50,468 --> 00:04:54,087
They shook their heads.@g]

67
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:59,746
"I'm not going to try," said a tall monkey.

68
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:02,720
"Me neither," said a short monkey.

69
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:05,884
A voice called out, "I'll do it!"

70
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:10,398
Everyone moved out of the way as the speaker stepped forward.

71
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,557
It was Monkey.

72
00:05:12,558 --> 00:05:14,808
[g@"Are you sure?" asked the gibbon.

73
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:16,899
"It looks dangerous."@g]

74
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,774
Monkey laughed. "I'm not afraid of anything!

75
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:23,631
And when I come back, I will be king!"

76
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:31,587
Monkey took a deep breath and leaped into the waterfall.
