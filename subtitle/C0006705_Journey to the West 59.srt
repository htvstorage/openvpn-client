"Can we please stop to rest?" moaned Bajie one day.

2
255:36:50,933.3329999446869 --> 385:40:10,933.3329999446869
The group had spent the morning walking down a long mountain trail.

3
385:41:50,933.3329999446869 --> 507:11:50,933.3329999446869
"My knees feel weak!" cried the pig.

4
507:13:30,933.3329999446869 --> 621:33:30,933.3330001831055
"We'll rest in a little while, Bajie," said the Tang Monk.

5
621:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 768:31:50,933.3330001831055
As they walked, the travelers started to hear the sound of rushing water.

6
768:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 841:23:30,933.3330001831055
It grew louder and louder.

7
841:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 932:55:10,933.3330001831055
"We're approaching a river," said Wujing.

8
932:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1029:28:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The trail went around a hill.

1029:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1150:16:50,933.3330001831055
A moment later the travelers saw the river.@g]

1150:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1251:31:50,933.3330001831055
"How will we cross this river?" said the Tang Monk.

11
1251:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1338:41:50,933.3330001831055
"It's so wide, I can't see the other side."

12
1338:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1494:16:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong leaped into the air and looked around.

13
1494:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1577:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"There's a small village nearby," he said.

14
1577:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1696:01:50,933.3330001831055
"Maybe someone there has a boat."@g]

1696:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1759:45:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The group walked to the village.

16
1759:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1838:51:50,933.3330001831055
The street was deserted.@g]

17
1838:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1979:58:30,933.3330001831055
A few villagers peeked out of windows and from behind doors.

18
1980:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2033:36:50,933.3330001831055
They looked scared.

19
2033:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2114:33:30,933.3330001831055
A man was getting water from a well.

20
2114:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2191:06:50,933.3330001831055
"Hello!" said Wukong.

21
2191:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2357:00:10,933.3330001831055
Startled, the man dropped his bucket down the well and spun around.

22
2357:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2420:50:10,933.3330001831055
"Wh-who are you?"

23
2420:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2488:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk stepped forward.

24
2488:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2542:08:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm from the Tang Empire.@g]

2542:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2674:06:50,933.3330001831055
We're traveling to the Western Paradise to get scriptures from Buddha."

26
2674:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2727:21:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The man relaxed a bit.

27
2727:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2776:01:50,933.3330001831055
"That's wonderful!"@g]

28
2776:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2884:40:10,933.3330001831055
"We need a boat to get across the river," said Bajie.

29
2884:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2958:05:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"I don't have a boat," said the man.

30
2958:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3013:55:10,933.3330001831055

[g@Please come with me.

3049:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3093:30:10,933.3330001831055
I'll make some tea.

33
3093:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3210:58:30,933.3330001831055
My name is Chen."@g]

3211:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3311:25:10,933.3330001831055
The travelers followed Chen to his home.

35
3311:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3437:23:30,933.3330001831055
Inside, they sat down as Chen boiled water for tea.

36
3437:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3593:48:30,933.3330001831055
"Why does everyone in this village seem so scared?" asked the Tang Monk.

37
3593:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3699:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Chen sighed and sat down.

38
3699:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3773:15:10,933.3330001831055
He started to cry.@g]

3773:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3877:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"My dear man," said the Tang Monk. "What's wrong?

40
3877:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3921:58:30,933.3330001831055
Did I upset you?"@g]

41
3922:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4022:23:30,933.3330001831055
"No," said Chen through his tears.

42
4022:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4130:40:10,933.3330001831055
"It's just that life is very bad in this village.

4130:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4257:21:50,933.3330001831055
A few years ago, a terrible demon arrived.

44
4257:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4365:23:30,933.3330001831055
He's always treated us badly, but now things are worse.

45
4365:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4435:25:10,933.3330001831055
He demanded that we give him a child.

46
4435:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4536:06:50,933.3330001831055
If we don't, he'll destroy our entire village.

47
4536:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4678:56:50,933.3330001831055
Tomorrow morning I must . . . hand over my son!"

48
4678:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4804:03:30,933.3330001831055
Chen burst into tears all over again.

49
4804:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4874:16:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong giggled and then laughed.

50
4874:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4941:45:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk glared at the monkey.

51
4941:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5025:41:50,933.3330001831055
"Wukong! Why are you laughing?"@g]

52
5025:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5067:25:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie shook his head.

53
5067:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5123:25:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"He's cruel, Master.

5123:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5225:33:30,933.3330001831055
You should recite the Tight Headband spell."@g]

5225:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5340:51:50,933.3330001831055
"There's no need for that," said Wukong, still laughing.

56
5340:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5383:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@He turned to Chen.

57
5383:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5445:26:50,933.3330001831055
"I'm not laughing at you, sir.@g]

5445:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5558:51:50,933.3330001831055
I'm laughing because today is the luckiest day of your life."

59
5558:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5613:21:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Chen raised his eyebrows.

5613:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5712:08:30,933.3330001831055
"How am I lucky?"@g]

61
5712:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5803:08:30,933.3330001831055
"You've probably never heard of me," said Wukong.

62
5803:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5897:40:10,933.3330001831055
"But I am Sun Wukong, the Monkey King.

5897:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5996:15:10,933.3330001831055
I once defeated the Jade Emperor's entire army.

64
5996:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6089:28:30,933.3330001831055
And tomorrow I will save your son's life."

65
6089:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6170:33:30,933.3330001831055
"Are you a spirit?" asked Chen.

66
6170:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6271:41:50,933.3330001831055
"Yes, a very powerful spirit," said Wukong.

67
6271:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6309:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Bring your son out here.

6309:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6361:55:10,933.3330001831055
I need to look at him."@g]

69
6361:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6469:25:10,933.3330001831055
Chen left the room for a moment.

70
6469:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6553:28:30,933.3330001831055
When he came back, a small boy was with him.

71
6553:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6790:56:50,933.3330001831055
"This is my son," said Chen.

72
6790:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6982:38:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong walked around the boy, examining him closely.

73
6982:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7151:35:10,933.3330001831055
Finally the monkey folded his arms and said, "I have a plan."

74
7151:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7257:35:10,933.3330001831055
The next morning the boy climbed onto a small platform.

75
7257:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7395:33:30,933.3330001831055
Several villagers carried the platform to the edge of the river.

7395:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7557:36:50,933.3330001831055
They placed the platform on the ground and then backed away.

77
7557:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7639:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@For a moment everything was quiet.

7639:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7724:46:50,933.3330001831055
The boy sat alone on the platform.@g]

7724:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7837:11:50,933.3330001831055
Suddenly a dark cloud approached.

80
7837:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7935:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@A fierce-looking demon emerged from the cloud.

81
7935:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7997:40:10,933.3330001831055
It had sharp teeth.@g]

82
7997:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8210:48:30,933.3330001831055
The boy smiled at the demon. "Hello!"
