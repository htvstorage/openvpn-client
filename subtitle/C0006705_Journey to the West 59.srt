1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:20,134
"Can we please stop to rest?" moaned Bajie one day.

2
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:24,817
The group had spent the morning walking down a long mountain trail.

3
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:29,192
"My knees feel weak!" cried the pig.

4
00:00:29,193 --> 00:00:33,309
"We'll rest in a little while, Bajie," said the Tang Monk.

5
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,600
As they walked, the travelers started to hear the sound of rushing water.

6
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:41,223
It grew louder and louder.

7
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:44,518
"We're approaching a river," said Wujing.

8
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:47,994
The trail went around a hill.

9
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:52,343
A moment later the travelers saw the river.

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:55,988
"How will we cross this river?" said the Tang Monk.

11
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,126
"It's so wide, I can't see the other side."

12
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:04,727
Wukong leaped into the air and looked around.

13
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:07,734
"There's a small village nearby," he said.

14
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:11,990
"Maybe someone there has a boat."

15
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:14,284
The group walked to the village.

16
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:17,132
The street was deserted.

17
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:22,212
A few villagers peeked out of windows and from behind doors.

18
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:24,143
They looked scared.

19
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:27,057
A man was getting water from a well.

20
00:01:27,058 --> 00:01:29,813
"Hello!" said Wukong.

21
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:35,785
Startled, the man dropped his bucket down the well and spun around.

22
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:38,083
"Wh-who are you?"

23
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:40,523
The Tang Monk stepped forward.

24
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:42,450
"I'm from the Tang Empire.

25
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:47,201
We're traveling to the Western Paradise to get scriptures from Buddha."

26
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:49,118
The man relaxed a bit.

27
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,870
"That's wonderful!"

28
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:54,781
"We need a boat to get across the river," said Bajie.

29
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,424
"I don't have a boat," said the man.

30
00:01:57,425 --> 00:01:59,434
"But someone in the village might.

31
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:00,721
Please come with me.

32
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:02,299
I'll make some tea.

33
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,528
My name is Chen."

34
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:10,144
The travelers followed Chen to his home.

35
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:14,679
Inside, they sat down as Chen boiled water for tea.

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,310
"Why does everyone in this village seem so scared?" asked the Tang Monk.

37
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:24,125
Chen sighed and sat down.

38
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:26,770
He started to cry.

39
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,534
"My dear man," said the Tang Monk. "What's wrong?

40
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:32,124
Did I upset you?"

41
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,739
"No," said Chen through his tears.

42
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,637
"It's just that life is very bad in this village.

43
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:44,198
A few years ago, a terrible demon arrived.

44
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,087
He's always treated us badly, but now things are worse.

45
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:50,608
He demanded that we give him a child.

46
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:54,233
If we don't, he'll destroy our entire village.

47
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:59,375
Tomorrow morning I must . . . hand over my son!"

48
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:03,879
Chen burst into tears all over again.

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,407
Wukong giggled and then laughed.

50
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:08,836
The Tang Monk glared at the monkey.

51
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:11,858
"Wukong! Why are you laughing?"

52
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,360
Bajie shook his head.

53
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,376
"He's cruel, Master.

54
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:19,053
You should recite the Tight Headband spell."

55
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:23,204
"There's no need for that," said Wukong, still laughing.

56
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:24,725
He turned to Chen.

57
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:26,969
"I'm not laughing at you, sir.

58
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,052
I'm laughing because today is the luckiest day of your life."

59
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:33,014
Chen raised his eyebrows.

60
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:36,570
"How am I lucky?"

61
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:39,846
"You've probably never heard of me," said Wukong.

62
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:43,249
"But I am Sun Wukong, the Monkey King.

63
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,798
I once defeated the Jade Emperor's entire army.

64
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,154
And tomorrow I will save your son's life."

65
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:53,073
"Are you a spirit?" asked Chen.

66
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:56,714
"Yes, a very powerful spirit," said Wukong.

67
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:58,069
"Bring your son out here.

68
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,962
I need to look at him."

69
00:03:59,963 --> 00:04:03,832
Chen left the room for a moment.

70
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,858
When he came back, a small boy was with him.

71
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:15,407
"This is my son," said Chen.

72
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:22,308
Wukong walked around the boy, examining him closely.

73
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:28,390
Finally the monkey folded his arms and said, "I have a plan."

74
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:32,206
The next morning the boy climbed onto a small platform.

75
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:37,173
Several villagers carried the platform to the edge of the river.

76
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:43,007
They placed the platform on the ground and then backed away.

77
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:45,962
For a moment everything was quiet.

78
00:04:45,963 --> 00:04:49,025
The boy sat alone on the platform.

79
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:53,072
Suddenly a dark cloud approached.

80
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:56,621
A fierce-looking demon emerged from the cloud.

81
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:58,849
It had sharp teeth.

82
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:06,522
The boy smiled at the demon. "Hello!"
