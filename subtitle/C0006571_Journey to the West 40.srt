00:00:11,266.66699999999946 --> 354:40:11,266.6670000553131
Bajie was in the cave when the door opened.

2
354:41:51,266.6670000553131 --> 664:43:31,266.66699981689453
Two small demons entered, dragging Wujing and the Tang Monk.

3
664:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 769:40:11,266.66699981689453
"What happened?" cried Bajie after the demons left.

4
769:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 862:46:51,266.66699981689453
"A demon attacked us," said Wujing.

5
862:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 950:45:11,266.66699981689453
"I tried to fight him, but he was too powerful."

6
950:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1021:40:11,266.66699981689453
"I'm worried," said the Tang Monk.

7
1021:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1118:28:31,266.66699981689453
"We don't know what happened to Wukong."

8
1118:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1282:36:51,266.66699981689453
In another room inside the cave, Golden Horn talked to some smaller demons.

9
1282:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1445:00:11,266.66699981689453
They all laughed when Golden Horn told them [n@Wukong was trapped under three mountains.

10
1445:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1546:05:11,266.66699981689453
"Let's celebrate!" said one demon.

11
1546:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1648:41:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"Not yet," said Golden Horn.

12
1648:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1841:51:51,266.66699981689453
"I'm afraid Sun Wukong might escape."@g]

13
1841:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1928:46:51,266.66699981689453
He handed a gourd to one of the demons.

14
1928:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2042:43:31,266.66699981689453
"Take this magic gourd to the monkey.

15
2042:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2185:41:51,266.66699981689453
Say his name, and he will be sucked into the gourd.

16
2185:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2337:10:11,266.66699981689453
After an hour he will turn into liquid."

17
2337:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2514:18:31,266.66699981689453
"Yes, Master," said the small demon.

18
2514:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2648:21:51,266.66699981689453
"Grr!" Wukong pushed as hard as he could.

19
2648:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2773:18:31,266.66699981689453
But the mountains were too heavy.

20
2773:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2907:23:31,266.66699981689453
"How will I ever get out of this?" thought the monkey.

21
2907:25:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3104:26:51,266.66699981689453
He was about to push again when the mountains rose into the air.

22
3104:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3218:43:31,266.66699981689453
Wukong jumped to his feet and looked around.

23
3218:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3296:56:51,266.66699981689453
A spirit stood nearby.

24
3296:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3397:41:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"Wukong, I am the spirit of these mountains.

25
3397:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3444:25:11,266.66699981689453
Please forgive me.@g]

26
3444:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3720:10:11,266.66699981689453
I tried to stop that demon from taking [n@my mountains, but he was too powerful."

27
3720:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3855:56:51,266.66699981689453
The spirit bowed and then vanished with the mountains.

28
3855:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3960:16:51,266.66699981689453
"I'm lucky that spirit arrived," said Wukong.

29
3960:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4043:58:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"Now I must find my companions.

30
4044:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4361:56:51,266.66699981689453
I wonder where that demon lives."@g]

31
4361:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4474:13:31,266.66699981689453
He spotted a small demon coming down the road.

32
4474:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4571:25:11,266.66699981689453
The demon was carrying a gourd.

33
4571:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4712:25:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong ducked behind a rock before the demon saw him.

34
4712:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4797:18:31,266.66699981689453
"Another demon," thought the monkey.

35
4797:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4901:35:11,266.66699981689453
"He probably knows the one who trapped me under the mountains."

36
4901:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5112:40:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong made himself look like a demon and stepped back onto the road.

37
5112:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5238:10:11,266.66699981689453
"Hello!" he called. "Where are you going?"

38
5238:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5406:38:31,266.66699981689453
"My master sent me to capture Sun Wukong," said the demon.

39
5406:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5546:16:51,266.66699981689453
Wukong laughed. "I know that monkey, and I don't like him at all.

40
5546:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5606:20:11,266.66699981689453
I'll help you capture him."

41
5606:21:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5680:45:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"Thank you," said the demon.

42
5680:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5814:21:51,266.66699981689453
"But I can catch him myself quite easily."@g]

43
5814:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5899:26:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"Oh, really?" asked Wukong.

44
5899:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5951:41:51,266.66699981689453
"How will you catch him?"@g]

45
5951:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6035:01:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The demon showed Wukong his gourd.

46
6035:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6106:33:31,266.66699981689453
"This gourd is magical.@g]

47
6106:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6193:51:51,266.66699981689453
It can hold a demon or a spirit.

48
6193:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6365:38:31,266.66699981689453
I just have to say 'Sun Wukong,' and he'll be sucked into it.

49
6365:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6558:13:31,266.66699981689453
After an hour he'll turn into liquid."

50
6558:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6705:00:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong laughed. "I have a better gourd."

51
6705:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6844:58:31,266.66699981689453
He quickly plucked a hair and turned it into a gourd.

52
6845:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6910:25:11,266.66699981689453
[g@He showed the gourd to the demon.

53
6910:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6988:33:31,266.66699981689453
"It can hold all of Heaven!"@g]

54
6988:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7060:46:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The demon looked interested.

55
7060:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7179:35:11,266.66699981689453
"I wish I had your gourd."@g]

56
7179:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7244:25:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"Well," said Wukong.

57
7244:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7372:45:11,266.66699981689453
"I might be willing to trade gourds with you."@g]

58
7372:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7466:11:51,266.66699981689453
The demon gave Wukong a suspicious look.

59
7466:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7549:58:31,266.66699981689453
"How do I know you're telling the truth?

60
7550:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7642:56:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Prove that your gourd can hold all of Heaven.

61
7642:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7717:06:51,266.66699981689453
Then we'll trade."@g]

62
7717:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7794:41:51,266.66699981689453
"I'll prove it to you," said Wukong.

63
7794:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7955:21:51,266.66699981689453
The monkey recited a quick spell and left his body standing on the road.

64
7955:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8046:11:51,266.66699981689453
He flew fast up to Heaven.

65
8046:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8193:08:31,266.66699981689453
"I must make it look like Heaven got sucked into this gourd," he thought.

66
8193:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8301:28:31,266.66699981689453
"I'll ask the guard to close the gate and dim the stars.

67
8301:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8493:10:11,266.66699981689453
Then it will look like Heaven's gone."

68
8493:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 8616:06:51,266.66699981689453
"Greetings, Wukong," said the guard at the southern gate of Heaven.

69
8616:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8744:43:31,266.66699981689453
"I need to pretend that Heaven has been sucked into a gourd," said Wukong.

70
8744:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8866:10:11,266.66699981689453
"When I say 'Heaven,' close the gate and dim the stars."

71
8866:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 9138:51:51,266.66699981689453
The guard frowned. "I can't do that!"
