1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:24,035
Bajie was in the cave when the door opened.

2
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:35,197
Two small demons entered, dragging Wujing and the Tang Monk.

3
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:38,975
"What happened?" cried Bajie after the demons left.

4
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:42,327
"A demon attacked us," said Wujing.

5
00:00:42,328 --> 00:00:45,494
"I tried to fight him, but he was too powerful."

6
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:48,047
"I'm worried," said the Tang Monk.

7
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,532
"We don't know what happened to Wukong."

8
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:57,441
In another room inside the cave, Golden Horn talked to some smaller demons.

9
00:00:57,442 --> 00:01:03,287
They all laughed when Golden Horn told them [n@Wukong was trapped under three mountains.

10
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:06,926
"Let's celebrate!" said one demon.

11
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:10,620
[g@"Not yet," said Golden Horn.

12
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:17,574
"I'm afraid Sun Wukong might escape."@g]

13
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:20,703
He handed a gourd to one of the demons.

14
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:24,805
"Take this magic gourd to the monkey.

15
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:29,952
Say his name, and he will be sucked into the gourd.

16
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:35,405
After an hour he will turn into liquid."

17
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:41,782
"Yes, Master," said the small demon.

18
00:01:41,783 --> 00:01:46,608
"Grr!" Wukong pushed as hard as he could.

19
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:51,106
But the mountains were too heavy.

20
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:55,933
"How will I ever get out of this?" thought the monkey.

21
00:01:55,934 --> 00:02:03,027
He was about to push again when the mountains rose into the air.

22
00:02:03,028 --> 00:02:07,141
Wukong jumped to his feet and looked around.

23
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:09,957
A spirit stood nearby.

24
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:13,584
[g@"Wukong, I am the spirit of these mountains.

25
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:15,266
Please forgive me.@g]

26
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:25,193
I tried to stop that demon from taking [n@my mountains, but he was too powerful."

27
00:02:25,194 --> 00:02:30,081
The spirit bowed and then vanished with the mountains.

28
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:33,837
"I'm lucky that spirit arrived," said Wukong.

29
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:36,850
[g@"Now I must find my companions.

30
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:48,297
I wonder where that demon lives."@g]

31
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:52,339
He spotted a small demon coming down the road.

32
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,838
The demon was carrying a gourd.

33
00:02:55,839 --> 00:03:00,914
Wukong ducked behind a rock before the demon saw him.

34
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:03,970
"Another demon," thought the monkey.

35
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:07,724
"He probably knows the one who trapped me under the mountains."

36
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:15,323
Wukong made himself look like a demon and stepped back onto the road.

37
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:19,841
"Hello!" he called. "Where are you going?"

38
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:25,906
"My master sent me to capture Sun Wukong," said the demon.

39
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:30,933
Wukong laughed. "I know that monkey, and I don't like him at all.

40
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:33,095
I'll help you capture him."

41
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:35,774
[g@"Thank you," said the demon.

42
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:40,584
"But I can catch him myself quite easily."@g]

43
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:43,647
[g@"Oh, really?" asked Wukong.

44
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:45,528
"How will you catch him?"@g]

45
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:48,528
[g@The demon showed Wukong his gourd.

46
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:51,103
"This gourd is magical.@g]

47
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:54,246
It can hold a demon or a spirit.

48
00:03:54,247 --> 00:04:00,430
I just have to say 'Sun Wukong,' and he'll be sucked into it.

49
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:07,363
After an hour he'll turn into liquid."

50
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:12,647
Wukong laughed. "I have a better gourd."

51
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:17,686
He quickly plucked a hair and turned it into a gourd.

52
00:04:17,687 --> 00:04:20,042
[g@He showed the gourd to the demon.

53
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:22,855
"It can hold all of Heaven!"@g]

54
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:25,455
[g@The demon looked interested.

55
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:29,732
"I wish I had your gourd."@g]

56
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:32,066
[g@"Well," said Wukong.

57
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:36,686
"I might be willing to trade gourds with you."@g]

58
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:40,050
The demon gave Wukong a suspicious look.

59
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:43,066
"How do I know you're telling the truth?

60
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:46,413
[g@Prove that your gourd can hold all of Heaven.

61
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:49,083
Then we'll trade."@g]

62
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:51,876
"I'll prove it to you," said Wukong.

63
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:57,660
The monkey recited a quick spell and left his body standing on the road.

64
00:04:57,661 --> 00:05:00,930
He flew fast up to Heaven.

65
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:06,220
"I must make it look like Heaven got sucked into this gourd," he thought.

66
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:10,120
"I'll ask the guard to close the gate and dim the stars.

67
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:17,021
Then it will look like Heaven's gone."

68
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:21,447
"Greetings, Wukong," said the guard at the southern gate of Heaven.

69
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:26,077
"I need to pretend that Heaven has been sucked into a gourd," said Wukong.

70
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:30,449
"When I say 'Heaven,' close the gate and dim the stars."

71
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:40,266
The guard frowned. "I can't do that!"
