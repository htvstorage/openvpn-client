1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,761
"Help!" cried Bajie.

2
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:19,543
Spiderwebs now covered the pig so he couldn't move at all.

3
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:22,354
Wukong quickly grew tall.

4
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,894
He swung his iron bar furiously at the young women.

5
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:29,424
"Oh no!" cried one woman.

6
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:33,468
"The monkey is a powerful spirit!" cried another.

7
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:36,408
"We must leave!" cried the third.

8
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:38,790
Poof! The women vanished.

9
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,292
Wukong ran into the house.

10
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:45,778
He saw a large form wrapped in spiderwebs in a corner.

11
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,791
"Master!" cried the monkey.

12
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:52,208
He quickly pulled off the webs.

13
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:56,006
"Thank you, Wukong," said the monk breathlessly.

14
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:58,746
"Those women were planning to eat me!"

15
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:01,688
"Those women are gone now," said Wukong.

16
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,008
Then he smirked.

17
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:06,149
"Bajie scared them away.

18
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,755
The pig was a real hero!"

19
00:01:10,756 --> 00:01:15,101
"Wonderful," said the Tang Monk as they went outside.

20
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:16,980
"Where is Bajie now?"

21
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:18,129
"He's right there."

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,151
Wukong pointed and laughed.

23
00:01:22,152 --> 00:01:26,690
"Bajie, the brave hero!"

24
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:31,889
Bajie was on the ground, still struggling to get out of the webs.

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,989
He pretended to laugh.

26
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,713
"Ha-ha, Wukong. Very funny."

27
00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:44,366
The road left the forest and headed up a mountain.

28
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:48,071
The travelers arrived at a Daoist abbey.

29
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:51,147
"Maybe we can rest here," said Wujing.

30
00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:54,357
The group entered the abbey.

31
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:59,493
An old priest was inside, mixing a potion.

32
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,844
"Visitors!" said the priest.

33
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:04,702
"Come in, and make yourselves at home."

34
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:08,526
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

35
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:15,882
The priest led them to a sitting area.

36
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:19,960
"You're Buddhists," the priest observed as everyone sat down.

37
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:21,864
"Where are you going?"

38
00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:26,936
The Tang Monk opened his mouth to answer, but Wukong spoke first.

39
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:30,573
"We're on our way to visit friends," said the monkey.

40
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:34,052
"That's nice," said the priest.

41
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,623
"Would you like some tea?

42
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:37,849
I have plenty of food too.

43
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,360
I will prepare a meal for us."

44
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:43,910
"That would be wonderful," said Bajie.

45
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:47,979
The priest stood up and left the room.

46
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,221
"Wukong, why did you lie to the priest?" asked the Tang Monk.

47
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:55,711
"I'm just being careful," said the monkey.

48
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:59,537
"We shouldn't tell everyone we meet that you're the Tang Monk."

49
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:00,910
Wujing nodded.

50
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,995
"Wukong is right, Master.

51
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:06,286
You almost got eaten just this morning."

52
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:10,127
The priest was in the kitchen, boiling water for tea.

53
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:14,976
He was looking for rice when he realized he wasn't alone.

54
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:20,478
The three young women stood nearby, and they looked angry.

55
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,608
"Hello, my dear friends," said the priest.

56
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:26,122
"What's wrong? You look upset."

57
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,839
"We caught the Tang Monk this morning," said one woman.

58
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,808
"But we had to flee our house," said another woman.

59
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:37,967
"A monkey and a pig attacked us," said the third.

60
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,630
"I have visitors right now," the priest whispered.

61
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:43,967
"There's a monk with three companions.

62
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:47,048
One is a monkey and another is a pig!"

63
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:50,419
"Are you serious?" whispered the first woman.

64
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,975
"It must be them," whispered the second woman.

65
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:57,143
"They must not leave!" whispered the third.

66
00:03:57,144 --> 00:04:01,536
An evil smile flashed across the priest's face.

67
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:06,622
"We'll eat the Tang Monk, and we'll all live forever!"

68
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:09,146
The first woman now looked worried.

69
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:12,411
"But how will we defeat the monk's companions?

70
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:18,037
That monkey is powerful."

71
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:22,208
The priest went to a cabinet and pulled out a small bottle.

72
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:27,237
"I'll add this poison to their tea."

73
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:32,939
The priest returned to the travelers.

74
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:39,116
"Sorry I took so long," he said, smiling.

75
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:41,145
"The meal will be ready soon.

76
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:43,138
Here's your tea."

77
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,619
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

78
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,013
Wukong looked at the priest and suddenly felt suspicious.

79
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:54,381
There was something evil behind the man's smile.

80
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:56,978
The monkey glanced at his tea.

81
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:00,317
It didn't look quite right.

82
00:05:00,318 --> 00:05:03,911
"Master!" cried the monkey. "Don't drink theâ€”"

83
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,873
But it was too late.

84
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:16,914
The monk, Wujing, and Bajie were already sipping their tea.
