1
00:00:11,000 --> 104:28:31,000
"Help!" cried Bajie.

2
104:30:11,000 --> 237:18:31,000
Spiderwebs now covered the pig so he couldn't move at all.

3
237:20:11,000 --> 315:23:31,000
Wukong quickly grew tall.

4
315:25:11,000 --> 441:30:11,000
He swung his iron bar furiously at the young women.

5
441:31:51,000 --> 511:46:51,000
"Oh no!" cried one woman.

6
511:48:31,000 --> 624:06:51,000
"The monkey is a powerful spirit!" cried another.

7
624:08:31,000 --> 705:46:51,000
"We must leave!" cried the third.

8
705:48:31,000 --> 771:56:51,000
[g@[i@Poof!@i] The women vanished.

9
771:58:31,000 --> 841:26:51,000
Wukong ran into the house.@g]

10
841:28:31,000 --> 966:03:31,000
He saw a large form wrapped in spiderwebs in a corner.

11
966:05:11,000 --> 1049:45:11,000
[g@"Master!" cried the monkey.

12
1049:46:51,000 --> 1144:40:11,000
He quickly pulled off the webs.@g]

13
1144:41:51,000 --> 1250:10:11,000
"Thank you, Wukong," said the monk breathlessly.

14
1250:11:51,000 --> 1326:16:51,000
"Those women were planning to eat me!"

15
1326:18:31,000 --> 1408:00:11,000
[g@"Those women are gone now," said Wukong.

16
1408:01:51,000 --> 1472:26:51,000
Then he smirked.@g]

17
1472:28:31,000 --> 1531:55:11,000
[g@"Bajie scared them away.

18
1531:56:51,000 --> 1659:51:51,000
The pig was a real hero!"@g]

19
1659:53:31,000 --> 1780:35:11,000
[g@"Wonderful," said the Tang Monk as they went outside.

20
1780:36:51,000 --> 1832:46:51,000
"Where is Bajie now?"@g]

21
1832:48:31,000 --> 1864:41:51,000
[g@"He's right there."

22
1864:43:31,000 --> 1976:25:11,000
Wukong pointed and laughed.@g]

23
1976:26:51,000 --> 2102:30:11,000
"Bajie, the brave hero!"

24
2102:31:51,000 --> 2246:55:11,000
Bajie was on the ground, still struggling to get out of the webs.

25
2246:56:51,000 --> 2305:15:11,000
[g@He pretended to laugh.

26
2305:16:51,000 --> 2464:15:11,000
"Ha-ha, Wukong. Very funny."@g]

27
2464:16:51,000 --> 2593:30:11,000
The road left the forest and headed up a mountain.

28
2593:31:51,000 --> 2696:25:11,000
The travelers arrived at a Daoist abbey.

29
2696:26:51,000 --> 2781:51:51,000
"Maybe we can rest here," said Wujing.

30
2781:53:31,000 --> 2871:01:51,000
[g@The group entered the abbey.

31
2871:03:31,000 --> 3013:41:51,000
An old priest was inside, mixing a potion.@g]

32
3013:43:31,000 --> 3079:00:11,000
[g@"Visitors!" said the priest.

33
3079:01:51,000 --> 3158:23:31,000
"Come in, and make yourselves at home."@g]

34
3158:25:11,000 --> 3264:36:51,000
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

35
3264:38:31,000 --> 3468:56:51,000
The priest led them to a sitting area.

36
3468:58:31,000 --> 3582:13:31,000
"You're Buddhists," the priest observed as everyone sat down.

37
3582:15:11,000 --> 3635:06:51,000
"Where are you going?"

38
3635:08:31,000 --> 3776:00:11,000
The Tang Monk opened his mouth to answer, but Wukong spoke first.

39
3776:01:51,000 --> 3877:01:51,000
"We're on our way to visit friends," said the monkey.

40
3877:03:31,000 --> 3973:40:11,000
[g@"That's nice," said the priest.

41
3973:41:51,000 --> 4017:18:31,000
"Would you like some tea?@g]

42
4017:20:11,000 --> 4079:08:31,000
[g@I have plenty of food too.

43
4079:10:11,000 --> 4148:53:31,000
I will prepare a meal for us."@g]

44
4148:55:11,000 --> 4247:30:11,000
"That would be wonderful," said Bajie.

45
4247:31:51,000 --> 4360:31:51,000
The priest stood up and left the room.

46
4360:33:31,000 --> 4478:21:51,000
"Wukong, why did you lie to the priest?" asked the Tang Monk.

47
4478:23:31,000 --> 4575:18:31,000
"I'm just being careful," said the monkey.

48
4575:20:11,000 --> 4681:35:11,000
"We shouldn't tell everyone we meet that you're the Tang Monk."

49
4681:36:51,000 --> 4719:43:31,000
Wujing nodded.

50
4719:45:11,000 --> 4777:38:31,000
[g@"Wukong is right, Master.

51
4777:40:11,000 --> 4869:03:31,000
You almost got eaten just this morning."@g]

52
4869:05:11,000 --> 4975:45:11,000
The priest was in the kitchen, boiling water for tea.

53
4975:46:51,000 --> 5110:26:51,000
He was looking for rice when he realized he wasn't alone.

54
5110:28:31,000 --> 5263:16:51,000
The three young women stood nearby, and they looked angry.

55
5263:18:31,000 --> 5350:13:31,000
[g@"Hello, my dear friends," said the priest.

56
5350:15:11,000 --> 5420:03:31,000
"What's wrong? You look upset."@g]

57
5420:05:11,000 --> 5523:18:31,000
"We caught the Tang Monk this morning," said one woman.

58
5523:20:11,000 --> 5633:33:31,000
"But we had to flee our house," said another woman.

59
5633:35:11,000 --> 5749:05:11,000
"A monkey and a pig attacked us," said the third.

60
5749:06:51,000 --> 5850:50:11,000
"I have visitors right now," the priest whispered.

61
5850:51:51,000 --> 5915:45:11,000
"There's a monk with three companions.

62
5915:46:51,000 --> 6001:20:11,000
One is a monkey and another is a pig!"

63
6001:21:51,000 --> 6094:58:31,000
"Are you serious?" whispered the first woman.

64
6095:00:11,000 --> 6193:45:11,000
"It must be them," whispered the second woman.

65
6193:46:51,000 --> 6281:45:11,000
"They must not leave!" whispered the third.

66
6281:46:51,000 --> 6403:46:51,000
An evil smile flashed across the priest's face.

67
6403:48:31,000 --> 6545:03:31,000
"We'll eat the Tang Monk, and we'll all live forever!"

68
6545:05:11,000 --> 6615:10:11,000
The first woman now looked worried.

69
6615:11:51,000 --> 6705:51:51,000
[g@"But how will we defeat the monk's companions?

70
6705:53:31,000 --> 6862:08:31,000
That monkey is powerful."@g]

71
6862:10:11,000 --> 6978:00:11,000
The priest went to a cabinet and pulled out a small bottle.

72
6978:01:51,000 --> 7117:41:51,000
"I'll add this poison to their tea."

73
7117:43:31,000 --> 7276:05:11,000
The priest returned to the travelers.

74
7276:06:51,000 --> 7447:40:11,000
"Sorry I took so long," he said, smiling.

75
7447:41:51,000 --> 7504:01:51,000
[g@"The meal will be ready soon.

76
7504:03:31,000 --> 7559:23:31,000
Here's your tea."@g]

77
7559:25:11,000 --> 7628:18:31,000
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

78
7628:20:11,000 --> 7750:21:51,000
Wukong looked at the priest and suddenly felt suspicious.

79
7750:23:31,000 --> 7871:41:51,000
There was something evil behind the man's smile.

80
7871:43:31,000 --> 7943:50:11,000
[g@The monkey glanced at his tea.

81
7943:51:51,000 --> 8036:35:11,000
It didn't look quite right.@g]

82
8036:36:51,000 --> 8136:25:11,000
"Master!" cried the monkey. "Don't drink theâ€”"

83
8136:26:51,000 --> 8190:55:11,000
But it was too late.

84
8190:56:51,000 --> 8497:36:51,000
The monk, Wujing, and Bajie were already sipping their tea.
