00:00:11,266.66699999999946 --> 235:08:31,266.6670000553131
"I hope we reach the Western Paradise soon," [n@said the Tang Monk one morning.

2
235:10:11,266.6670000553131 --> 386:40:11,266.6670000553131
Wukong and his companions were eating breakfast.

3
386:41:51,266.6670000553131 --> 532:28:31,266.6670000553131
The monkey laughed. "The journey will take many years, Master!

4
532:30:11,266.6670000553131 --> 644:25:11,266.66699981689453
And you must face many challenges along the way.

5
644:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 760:26:51,266.66699981689453
Buddha doesn't give the True Scriptures to just anyone.

6
760:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 928:38:31,266.66699981689453
You must prove you're worthy by surviving a long and difficult journey."

7
928:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 982:38:31,266.66699981689453
The monk sighed.

8
982:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1050:43:31,266.66699981689453
[g@Bajie put down his bowl.

9
1050:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1158:53:31,266.66699981689453
"I'm tired of this journey!" he cried.@g]

10
1158:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1274:53:31,266.66699981689453
"My legs hurt. And we never have enough food."

11
1274:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1384:20:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"Stop thinking about food, Bajie," said Wukong.

12
1384:21:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1447:18:31,266.66699981689453
"We're Buddhist monks now.@g]

13
1447:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1617:01:51,266.66699981689453
We should think only about reaching the Western Paradise."

14
1617:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1682:43:31,266.66699981689453
The pig sighed.

15
1682:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1822:48:31,266.66699981689453
After he washed the bowls, the three companions headed down the road.

16
1822:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1914:41:51,266.66699981689453
They soon reached a river.

17
1914:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2084:06:51,266.66699981689453
The water splashed, and a purple monster leaped from the waves.

18
2084:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2166:48:31,266.66699981689453
"Master, stay back!" shouted Wukong.

19
2166:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2344:36:51,266.66699981689453
He pulled out his iron bar and blocked the monster's spear. [i@Clang!@i]

20
2344:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2479:16:51,266.66699981689453
Bajie lunged at the monster, swinging his rake.

21
2479:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2564:56:51,266.66699981689453
The monster dived back into the river.

22
2564:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2679:08:31,266.66699981689453
"Bajie, my powers aren't strong underwater," said Wukong.

23
2679:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2763:35:11,266.66699981689453
"Dive in, and get him to chase you out of the river.

24
2763:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2817:38:31,266.66699981689453
Then I'll surprise him."

25
2817:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2873:50:11,266.66699981689453
"Okay," said the pig.

26
2873:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2972:03:31,266.66699981689453
"Let's wait until he comes all the way up on shore though.

27
2972:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3084:01:51,266.66699981689453
Then I'll block his path so he can't go back in the river."

28
3084:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3216:40:11,266.66699981689453
Bajie dived into the water. Wukong waited.

29
3216:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3354:33:31,266.66699981689453
A moment later the pig was back with the monster following.

30
3354:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3455:15:11,266.66699981689453
The monkey swung his iron barâ€”and missed.

31
3455:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3593:46:51,266.66699981689453
The monster dived back underwater.

32
3593:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3701:40:11,266.66699981689453
"You didn't wait until he was on shore," said Bajie.

33
3701:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3748:46:51,266.66699981689453
"You're too impatient!"

34
3748:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3836:26:51,266.66699981689453
Wukong shrugged and laughed.

35
3836:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3886:00:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"Let's yell at the monster.

36
3886:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3933:53:31,266.66699981689453
Maybe he'll come back."@g]

37
3933:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4057:31:51,266.66699981689453
Wukong and Bajie yelled at the river for more than an hour.

38
4057:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4174:06:51,266.66699981689453
But the monster did not come back.

39
4174:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4278:55:11,266.66699981689453
Finally the monkey sighed.

40
4278:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4362:41:51,266.66699981689453
"We can't cross this river with the monster in there.

41
4362:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4432:26:51,266.66699981689453
I'll ask Guanyin for help."

42
4432:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4579:10:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong went to Mount Potalaka and told Guanyin about the monster.

43
4579:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4689:16:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"His name is Sha Wujing," said Guanyin.

44
4689:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4740:30:11,266.66699981689453
"He was waiting for you.@g]

45
4740:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4870:46:51,266.66699981689453
He's going to help the Tang Monk reach the Western Paradise."

46
4870:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4984:55:11,266.66699981689453
"I didn't know that!" cried Wukong.

47
4984:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5114:13:31,266.66699981689453
Guanyin went back to the river with Wukong.

48
5114:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5254:26:51,266.66699981689453
"Sha Wujing!" she called. "The Tang Monk is here!"

49
5254:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5373:40:11,266.66699981689453
The monster jumped out of the river and bowed.

50
5373:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5451:05:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"I'm sorry, Bodhisattva," he said.

51
5451:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5518:40:11,266.66699981689453
"I didn't know he'd arrived."@g]

52
5518:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5629:23:31,266.66699981689453
"These two are his companions," said Guanyin.

53
5629:25:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5732:35:11,266.66699981689453
She waved her hand toward Wukong and Bajie.

54
5732:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5794:08:31,266.66699981689453
[g@Wujing looked surprised.

55
5794:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5848:11:51,266.66699981689453
"They attacked me!"@g]

56
5848:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5957:56:51,266.66699981689453
"You attacked us first!" shouted Bajie.

57
5957:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6038:58:31,266.66699981689453
"Stop arguing," said Guanyin.

58
6039:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6168:33:31,266.66699981689453
"Wujing, you will help the Tang Monk reach the West."

59
6168:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6253:53:31,266.66699981689453
"Yes, Bodhisattva," said Wujing.

60
6253:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6408:06:51,266.66699981689453
Guanyin disappeared, and Wujing joined the group.

61
6408:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6505:18:31,266.66699981689453
He led the horse while the Tang Monk rode.

62
6505:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6649:40:11,266.66699981689453
"I was being punished for breaking a glass in Heaven," said Wujing one day.

63
6649:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6751:11:51,266.66699981689453
"When we reach the Western Paradise, I will be forgiven."

64
6751:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6876:08:31,266.66699981689453
"Bajie and I were punished for crimes in Heaven too," said Wukong.

65
6876:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6919:10:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"So was the horse.

66
6919:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6998:40:11,266.66699981689453
Did you know the horse is really a dragon?"@g]

67
6998:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7061:26:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Wujing looked doubtful.

68
7061:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7151:38:31,266.66699981689453
"This horse is too slow to be a dragon."@g]

69
7151:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7270:13:31,266.66699981689453
"Oh, really?" said the monkey. "Watch this!"

70
7270:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7318:06:51,266.66699981689453
[g@He struck the horse.

71
7318:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7412:48:31,266.66699981689453
The horse shot down the road as fast as lightning.@g]

72
7412:50:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7508:56:51,266.66699981689453
Its reins were ripped from Wujing's hand.

73
7508:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7613:26:51,266.66699981689453
"Ahh!" cried the Tang Monk.

74
7613:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7780:01:51,266.66699981689453
When the horse finally stopped, the Tang Monk was in a dark forest.

75
7780:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7847:33:31,266.66699981689453
[g@He gasped in fear.

76
7847:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8068:01:51,266.66699981689453
The forest was filled with wolves, bears, and tigers!@g]
