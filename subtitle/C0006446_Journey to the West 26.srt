1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:19,732
"I hope we reach the Western Paradise soon," said the Tang Monk one morning.

2
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:25,187
Wukong and his companions were eating breakfast.

3
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:30,436
The monkey laughed. "The journey will take many years, Master!

4
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:34,466
And you must face many challenges along the way.

5
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:38,643
Buddha doesn't give the True Scriptures to just anyone.

6
00:00:38,644 --> 00:00:44,698
You must prove you're worthy by surviving a long and difficult journey."

7
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:46,642
The monk sighed.

8
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:49,093
Bajie put down his bowl.

9
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:52,987
"I'm tired of this journey!" he cried.

10
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:57,163
"My legs hurt. And we never have enough food."

11
00:00:57,164 --> 00:01:01,103
"Stop thinking about food, Bajie," said Wukong.

12
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:03,370
"We're Buddhist monks now.

13
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:09,480
We should think only about reaching the Western Paradise."

14
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:11,845
The pig sighed.

15
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:16,888
After he washed the bowls, the three companions headed down the road.

16
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:20,196
They soon reached a river.

17
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:26,295
The water splashed, and a purple monster leaped from the waves.

18
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:29,272
"Master, stay back!" shouted Wukong.

19
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:35,673
He pulled out his iron bar and blocked the monster's spear. Clang!

20
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:40,521
Bajie lunged at the monster, swinging his rake.

21
00:01:40,522 --> 00:01:43,605
The monster dived back into the river.

22
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:47,716
"Bajie, my powers aren't strong underwater," said Wukong.

23
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:50,756
"Dive in, and get him to chase you out of the river.

24
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:52,702
Then I'll surprise him."

25
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:54,725
"Okay," said the pig.

26
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:58,261
"Let's wait until he comes all the way up on shore though.

27
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:02,292
Then I'll block his path so he can't go back in the river."

28
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:07,067
Bajie dived into the water. Wukong waited.

29
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:12,031
A moment later the pig was back with the monster following.

30
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:15,656
The monkey swung his iron barâ€”and missed.

31
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:20,643
The monster dived back underwater.

32
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:24,527
"You didn't wait until he was on shore," said Bajie.

33
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:26,223
"You're too impatient!"

34
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:29,379
Wukong shrugged and laughed.

35
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,163
"Let's yell at the monster.

36
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:32,887
Maybe he'll come back."

37
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:37,338
Wukong and Bajie yelled at the river for more than an hour.

38
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:41,535
But the monster did not come back.

39
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,308
Finally the monkey sighed.

40
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:48,324
"We can't cross this river with the monster in there.

41
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,835
I'll ask Guanyin for help."

42
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:56,117
Wukong went to Mount Potalaka and told Guanyin about the monster.

43
00:02:56,118 --> 00:03:00,081
"His name is Sha Wujing," said Guanyin.

44
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:01,925
"He was waiting for you.

45
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:06,615
He's going to help the Tang Monk reach the Western Paradise."

46
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:10,724
"I didn't know that!" cried Wukong.

47
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:15,379
Guanyin went back to the river with Wukong.

48
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,427
"Sha Wujing!" she called. "The Tang Monk is here!"

49
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:24,719
The monster jumped out of the river and bowed.

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,506
"I'm sorry, Bodhisattva," he said.

51
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,939
"I didn't know he'd arrived."

52
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,925
"These two are his companions," said Guanyin.

53
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:37,640
She waved her hand toward Wukong and Bajie.

54
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:39,856
Wujing looked surprised.

55
00:03:39,857 --> 00:03:41,802
"They attacked me!"

56
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:45,753
"You attacked us first!" shouted Bajie.

57
00:03:45,754 --> 00:03:48,670
"Stop arguing," said Guanyin.

58
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:53,335
"Wujing, you will help the Tang Monk reach the West."

59
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:56,407
"Yes, Bodhisattva," said Wujing.

60
00:03:56,408 --> 00:04:01,959
Guanyin disappeared, and Wujing joined the group.

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,458
He led the horse while the Tang Monk rode.

62
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,655
"I was being punished for breaking a glass in Heaven," said Wujing one day.

63
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:14,310
"When we reach the Western Paradise, I will be forgiven."

64
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:18,808
"Bajie and I were punished for crimes in Heaven too," said Wukong.

65
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,357
"So was the horse.

66
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,219
Did you know the horse is really a dragon?"

67
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,479
Wujing looked doubtful.

68
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,726
"This horse is too slow to be a dragon."

69
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,995
"Oh, really?" said the monkey. "Watch this!"

70
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:34,719
He struck the horse.

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,128
The horse shot down the road as fast as lightning.

72
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:41,589
Its reins were ripped from Wujing's hand.

73
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,351
"Ahh!" cried the Tang Monk.

74
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:51,348
When the horse finally stopped, the Tang Monk was in a dark forest.

75
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,779
He gasped in fear.

76
00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:01,716
The forest was filled with wolves, bears, and tigers!
