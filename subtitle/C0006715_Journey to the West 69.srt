139:35:10,933.3330000042915 --> 226:26:50,933.3329999446869
"And she kidnapped the Tang Monk!"

355:46:50,933.3329999446869 --> 500:48:30,933.3329999446869
In the distance the monkey saw a dark cloud speeding toward a mountain.

500:50:10,933.3329999446869 --> 583:53:30,933.3329999446869

583:55:10,933.3329999446869 --> 728:00:10,933.3330001831055
"Quickly!" said Wujing. "We must catch her!"

728:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 880:13:30,933.3330001831055

1198:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1305:26:50,933.3330001831055
The door flew open, and the woman came out.

1459:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1587:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Release our master!" shouted Wukong, ignoring her questions.

16
1587:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1660:33:30,933.3330001831055

1810:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1900:55:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey attacked.

19
1900:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2064:28:30,933.3330001831055
The woman spun around fast, blocking his iron [n@bar and striking back with fury.

20
2064:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2160:28:30,933.3330001831055
"You shouldn't have come here!" she shouted as she fought.

21
2160:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2246:48:30,933.3330001831055
"Even Buddha is afraid of me!"

2246:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2362:51:50,933.3330001831055
Bajie tried to hit her with his rake but missed.

2362:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2464:18:30,933.3330001831055
The woman was now spinning faster and faster.

2464:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2559:55:10,933.3330001831055
"She's faster than a tornado!" cried the pig.

2559:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2613:41:50,933.3330001831055

2613:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2709:01:50,933.3330001831055

2709:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2819:26:50,933.3330001831055
"Ahh!" cried the monkey, grabbing his head.

28
2819:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2908:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"It hurts! It hurts!"

2908:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2980:06:50,933.3330001831055
He ran down the mountain.@g]

2980:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3105:46:50,933.3330001831055
Bajie and Wujing stared after Wukong in shock.

31
3105:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3218:08:30,933.3330001831055
The woman went back into her cave.

32
3218:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3305:51:50,933.3330001831055
"What happened to Wukong?" asked the pig.

33
3305:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3409:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Nothing hurts him except for the Tight Headband spell."

34
3409:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3568:03:30,933.3330001831055
"I don't know," said Wujing, scratching his head.

35
3568:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3708:58:30,933.3330001831055
They went down the mountain and found the monkey crouching by a stream.

36
3709:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3775:33:30,933.3330001831055
He was still holding his head.

37
3775:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3859:56:50,933.3330001831055
"Are you all right?" asked Wujing.

38
3859:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3980:33:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"That woman stabbed me in the head," moaned Wukong.

3980:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4148:21:50,933.3330001831055
"The pain is horrible!"@g]

4199:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4287:06:50,933.3330001831055
"You're always bragging about how tough you are.@g]

4287:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4386:28:30,933.3330001831055
Now you're crying about getting stabbed in the head?"

43
4386:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4475:36:50,933.3330001831055
"It hurts!" shouted the monkey.

4475:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4527:16:50,933.3330001831055

5335:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5464:46:50,933.3330001831055
The three companions returned to the cave.

56
5464:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5597:35:10,933.3330001831055
"Wukong, you stand back," said Bajie, laughing.

5829:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5932:16:50,933.3330001831055

6351:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6448:21:50,933.3330001831055
The woman spun around, faster and faster.

6448:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6556:50:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie and Wujing tried to strike her with their weapons.

6556:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6624:30:10,933.3330001831055
But the woman was too fast.

6624:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6779:58:30,933.3330001831055

6894:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7037:01:50,933.3330001831055
He covered his nose and ran back down the mountain.

71
7037:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7123:11:50,933.3330001831055

7252:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7396:08:30,933.3330001831055
Bajie was huddled on the ground, tears streaming from his eyes.
