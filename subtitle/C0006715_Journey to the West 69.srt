1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:15,957
"That woman was a demon!" cried Wukong.

2
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:19,085
"And she kidnapped the Tang Monk!"

3
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:23,740
He leaped into the air, and Bajie and Wujing followed.

4
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:28,962
In the distance the monkey saw a dark cloud speeding toward a mountain.

5
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:31,953
"That must be her," said Wukong.

6
00:00:31,954 --> 00:00:37,141
"Quickly!" said Wujing. "We must catch her!"

7
00:00:37,142 --> 00:00:42,621
They raced after the cloud, which disappeared when it reached the mountain.

8
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:46,862
They soon arrived at the mountain and found a cave.

9
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:49,205
Its door was closed.

10
00:00:49,206 --> 00:00:51,887
Wukong pounded on the cave door.

11
00:00:51,888 --> 00:00:54,091
"Open up!" he yelled.

12
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:57,929
The door flew open, and the woman came out.

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,802
"Who are you?" demanded the woman.

14
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:03,460
"Why are you pounding on my door?"

15
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:08,093
"Release our master!" shouted Wukong, ignoring her questions.

16
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:10,713
The woman laughed.

17
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:16,102
"Don't tell me what to do!"

18
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:19,366
The monkey attacked.

19
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:25,254
The woman spun around fast, blocking his iron bar and striking back with fury.

20
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:28,710
"You shouldn't have come here!" she shouted as she fought.

21
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:31,818
"Even Buddha is afraid of me!"

22
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:35,996
Bajie tried to hit her with his rake but missed.

23
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:39,648
The woman was now spinning faster and faster.

24
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:43,090
"She's faster than a tornado!" cried the pig.

25
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:45,026
Wukong leaped at the woman.

26
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:48,458
Suddenly he felt a stabbing pain.

27
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:52,433
"Ahh!" cried the monkey, grabbing his head.

28
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:55,633
"It hurts! It hurts!"

29
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:58,217
He ran down the mountain.

30
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:02,741
Bajie and Wujing stared after Wukong in shock.

31
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:06,786
The woman went back into her cave.

32
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:09,944
"What happened to Wukong?" asked the pig.

33
00:02:09,945 --> 00:02:13,671
"Nothing hurts him except for the Tight Headband spell."

34
00:02:13,672 --> 00:02:19,383
"I don't know," said Wujing, scratching his head.

35
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:24,456
They went down the mountain and found the monkey crouching by a stream.

36
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:26,853
He was still holding his head.

37
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:29,891
"Are you all right?" asked Wujing.

38
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:34,233
"That woman stabbed me in the head," moaned Wukong.

39
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:40,274
"The pain is horrible!"

40
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:42,109
Bajie snorted.

41
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,269
"You're always bragging about how tough you are.

42
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,846
Now you're crying about getting stabbed in the head?"

43
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:52,055
"It hurts!" shouted the monkey.

44
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:53,915
Wujing moved closer.

45
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,950
"Let me see where she stabbed you."

46
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:58,000
Wukong lowered his hands.

47
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,607
There was no injury.

48
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:03,831
Bajie laughed. "He's fine.

49
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:06,901
He just wants us to feel bad for him."

50
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:09,012
The monkey glared at the pig.

51
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:13,756
"I'm telling you, it hurts!"

52
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:15,756
He took a deep breath.

53
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:19,159
"The pain is going away now though.

54
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's go back up there and fight her again."

55
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:27,665
The three companions returned to the cave.

56
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:32,446
"Wukong, you stand back," said Bajie, laughing.

57
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:36,806
"I don't want you getting hurt again."

58
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:40,790
Wukong clenched his teeth.

59
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:44,495
The pig hit the door with his rake. Smash!

60
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:46,819
The door exploded.

61
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,933
The woman ran outside.

62
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:52,322
"You smashed my door!" she shouted.

63
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:55,287
"Release our master!" shouted the pig.

64
00:03:55,288 --> 00:03:59,586
"Or we'll smash your entire mountain!"

65
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:03,074
The woman spun around, faster and faster.

66
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:06,979
Bajie and Wujing tried to strike her with their weapons.

67
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,415
But the woman was too fast.

68
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:15,012
Wukong raised his iron bar, waiting for a good moment to strike.

69
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:19,127
Suddenly Bajie cried out, "Ahh!"

70
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:24,266
He covered his nose and ran back down the mountain.

71
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:27,368
The woman spun toward Wukong and Wujing.

72
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:32,024
They turned and ran back down the mountain.

73
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:37,194
Bajie was huddled on the ground, tears streaming from his eyes.

74
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:43,072
"It hurts so badly!"

75
00:04:43,073 --> 00:04:45,113
Wukong laughed.

76
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:48,812
"Don't laugh at me!" cried Bajie.

77
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:53,565
"She stabbed my nose!"

78
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:56,268
"You deserved it!" said the monkey.

79
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:59,274
"You didn't believe me when I got hurt."

80
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:02,447
"Stop arguing," said Wujing.

81
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:05,311
"We still have to save the Tang Monk."

82
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:09,493
"You're right," said Wukong. "Let's go back up there."

83
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:12,891
A voice called out, "Wait!"

84
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:14,672
It was Guanyin.

85
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:18,237
The bodhisattva was walking toward the group.

86
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:24,925
"Beware of that scorpion spirit!"
