1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,882
Wukong shouted outside the cave.

2
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:18,624
He shouted all kinds of insults about the Demon of Power.

3
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:21,481
Inside the cave the guard woke up.

4
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:25,271
He ran to the demon's bedroom.

5
00:00:25,272 --> 00:00:31,678
"Master!" cried the guard. "The monkey is back!"

6
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,736
"It's the middle of the night," said the demon.

7
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:36,946
"What does he want?"

8
00:00:36,947 --> 00:00:40,322
"He said we must return the queen," said the guard.

9
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:43,697
"If we don't, he'll smash our entire mountain.

10
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:48,525
He also yelled some terrible things about you."

11
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:52,731
The Demon of Power climbed out of bed and grabbed the fake bells.

12
00:00:52,732 --> 00:00:58,059
"I'll chase the monkey away with my fire, smoke, and sand again."

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,091
He tied the bells around his neck and went outside.

14
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:05,348
The demon glared at Wukong.

15
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,138
"Go away! I'm sleeping!"

16
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:12,942
"Return the queen!" shouted the monkey.

17
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:15,498
"Never!" said the demon.

18
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:18,045
He reached for the bells around his neck.

19
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:20,956
Wukong pretended to be surprised.

20
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:26,232
"Oh," he said. "I have bells just like those."

21
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,822
The demon squinted at the monkey.

22
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:31,901
"I doubt your bells are like mine.

23
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:34,577
Let me see them."

24
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:37,713
Wukong held up the bells.

25
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:40,372
The demon peered at them for a moment.

26
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:44,001
"Those bells do look like mine.

27
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:47,592
But my bells are magic."

28
00:01:47,593 --> 00:01:51,539
"So are mine," said Wukong.

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,805
"My bells can make fire, smoke, and sand," said the demon.

30
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:01,609
"That's interesting." Wukong smiled.

31
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,139
"My bells can do that too."

32
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,030
"Really?" The Demon of Power looked surprised.

33
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:13,165
"Let's compare bells to see whose work better."

34
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,976
"Okay," said Wukong. "You go first."

35
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:21,322
"I was planning to," said the demon.

36
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:24,901
He shook his bells.

37
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:28,747
Nothing happened.

38
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,351
He shook the bells again.

39
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:34,196
Again nothing happened.

40
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:37,133
"That's strange," the demon mumbled.

41
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:39,849
He looked closely at the bells.

42
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:45,058
"These bells worked fine yesterday."

43
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:47,747
Wukong tried not to laugh.

44
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:50,982
"Let's see if my bells work," he said.

45
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:55,061
The monkey shook the bells.

46
00:02:55,062 --> 00:03:00,254
Whoosh! Fire, smoke, and sand rushed toward the demon.

47
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:03,689
"Aargh!" cried the demon.

48
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,578
He covered his face and fell to the ground.

49
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:11,074
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and got ready to strike.

50
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:14,551
"Wukong, stop!" shouted a voice.

51
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:20,162
The monkey looked up and saw Guanyin coming down from the sky.

52
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:23,687
Wukong bowed. "Greetings, Bodhisattva.

53
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:26,722
I was just going to destroy this demon."

54
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:30,370
"You must not harm him," said Guanyin.

55
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,968
"He's my pet wolf.

56
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:34,267
He escaped from Heaven."

57
00:03:34,268 --> 00:03:36,991
The bodhisattva looked at the demon.

58
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:39,772
"Return to your true form!"

59
00:03:39,773 --> 00:03:45,318
Light sparkled, and the demon turned into a huge wolf.

60
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,013
Guanyin climbed onto the wolf's back.

61
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:52,461
She looked at the wolf's neck and then at Wukong.

62
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:55,642
"Give me the bells, Wukong."

63
00:03:55,643 --> 00:04:01,103
"What bells?" Wukong held the bells behind his back.

64
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:05,278
"My wolf wears a set of three bells," said Guanyin.

65
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,882
"I know you have them.

66
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:09,955
You could not have defeated the wolf without them."

67
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:14,079
Wukong shrugged. "I have no idea what you're—"

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,110
"Hand them over," said Guanyin.

69
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:21,615
"Or I'll recite the Tight Headband spell."

70
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:24,574
"There's no need for that!" cried the monkey.

71
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:26,432
"I was just joking!"

72
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,855
Grinning sheepishly, he handed over the bells.

73
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:39,443
Guanyin tied the bells around the wolf's neck and then rode up into the sky.

74
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:43,575
Back at the palace, the king and queen were reunited.

75
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:49,061
"Thank you for rescuing the queen, Sun Wukong," said the king.

76
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:55,993
"Tonight we will hold a feast to thank you and your companions," said the queen.

77
00:04:55,994 --> 00:05:00,260
That night the royal banquet hall was filled with people.

78
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:09,908
Servants carried trays filled with rice, vegetables, mushrooms, noodles, tofu, dumplings, and other food.

79
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:14,579
Bajie ate everything in front of him.

80
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,150
"Would you like more steamed buns?" asked a servant.

81
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:22,207
"You don't need to ask," said the pig.

82
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:31,260
"Just put food in front of me, and I'll eat it!"
