1
00:00:11,000 --> 80:03:31,000
Wukong shouted outside the cave.

2
80:05:11,000 --> 211:46:51,000
He shouted all kinds of insults about the Demon of Power.

3
211:48:31,000 --> 291:08:31,000
Inside the cave the guard woke up.

4
291:10:11,000 --> 396:25:11,000
He ran to the demon's bedroom.

5
396:26:51,000 --> 574:23:31,000
"Master!" cried the guard. "The monkey is back!"

6
574:25:11,000 --> 659:20:11,000
[g@"It's the middle of the night," said the demon.

7
659:21:51,000 --> 720:43:31,000
"What does he want?"@g]

8
720:45:11,000 --> 814:30:11,000
"He said we must return the queen," said the guard.

9
814:31:51,000 --> 908:15:11,000
"If we don't, he'll smash our entire mountain.

10
908:16:51,000 --> 1042:21:51,000
He also yelled some terrible things about you."

11
1042:23:31,000 --> 1159:11:51,000
The Demon of Power climbed out of bed and grabbed the fake bells.

12
1159:13:31,000 --> 1307:11:51,000
"I'll chase the monkey away with my fire, smoke, and sand again."

13
1307:13:31,000 --> 1446:58:31,000
He tied the bells around his neck and went outside.

14
1447:00:11,000 --> 1509:40:11,000
[g@The demon glared at Wukong.

15
1509:41:51,000 --> 1614:56:51,000
"Go away! I'm sleeping!"@g]

16
1614:58:31,000 --> 1720:36:51,000
"Return the queen!" shouted the monkey.

17
1720:38:31,000 --> 1791:36:51,000
[g@"Never!" said the demon.

18
1791:38:31,000 --> 1862:21:51,000
He reached for the bells around his neck.@g]

19
1862:23:31,000 --> 1943:13:31,000
Wukong pretended to be surprised.

20
1943:15:11,000 --> 2089:46:51,000
"Oh," he said. "I have bells just like those."

21
2089:48:31,000 --> 2161:43:31,000
The demon squinted at the monkey.

22
2161:45:11,000 --> 2247:15:11,000
[g@"I doubt your bells are like mine.

23
2247:16:51,000 --> 2321:35:11,000
Let me see them."@g]

24
2321:36:51,000 --> 2408:41:51,000
[g@Wukong held up the bells.

25
2408:43:31,000 --> 2482:33:31,000
The demon peered at them for a moment.@g]

26
2482:35:11,000 --> 2583:21:51,000
[g@"Those bells do look like mine.

27
2583:23:31,000 --> 2683:06:51,000
But my bells are magic."@g]

28
2683:08:31,000 --> 2792:45:11,000
"So are mine," said Wukong.

29
2792:46:51,000 --> 2994:35:11,000
"My bells can make fire, smoke, and sand," said the demon.

30
2994:36:51,000 --> 3072:28:31,000
[g@"That's interesting." Wukong smiled.

31
3072:30:11,000 --> 3142:45:11,000
"My bells can do that too."@g]

32
3142:46:51,000 --> 3278:36:51,000
"Really?" The Demon of Power looked surprised.

33
3278:38:31,000 --> 3393:28:31,000
"Let's compare bells to see whose work better."

34
3393:30:11,000 --> 3527:06:51,000
"Okay," said Wukong. "You go first."

35
3527:08:31,000 --> 3620:03:31,000
[g@"I was planning to," said the demon.

36
3620:05:11,000 --> 3719:28:31,000
He shook his bells.

37
3719:30:11,000 --> 3826:18:31,000
Nothing happened.@g]

38
3826:20:11,000 --> 3898:38:31,000
[g@He shook the bells again.

39
3898:40:11,000 --> 3977:40:11,000
Again nothing happened.@g]

40
3977:41:51,000 --> 4059:15:11,000
[g@"That's strange," the demon mumbled.

41
4059:16:51,000 --> 4134:41:51,000
He looked closely at the bells.@g]

42
4134:43:31,000 --> 4279:23:31,000
"These bells worked fine yesterday."

43
4279:25:11,000 --> 4354:05:11,000
[g@Wukong tried not to laugh.

44
4354:06:51,000 --> 4443:56:51,000
"Let's see if my bells work," he said.@g]

45
4443:58:31,000 --> 4557:15:11,000
The monkey shook the bells.

46
4557:16:51,000 --> 4701:30:11,000
[i@Whoosh!@i] Fire, smoke, and sand rushed toward the demon.

47
4701:31:51,000 --> 4796:55:11,000
[g@"Aargh!" cried the demon.

48
4796:56:51,000 --> 4877:10:11,000
He covered his face and fell to the ground.@g]

49
4877:11:51,000 --> 5002:03:31,000
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and got ready to strike.

50
5002:05:11,000 --> 5098:38:31,000
"Wukong, stop!" shouted a voice.

51
5098:40:11,000 --> 5254:30:11,000
The monkey looked up and saw Guanyin coming down from the sky.

52
5254:31:51,000 --> 5352:25:11,000
Wukong bowed. "Greetings, Bodhisattva.

53
5352:26:51,000 --> 5436:43:31,000
I was just going to destroy this demon."

54
5436:45:11,000 --> 5538:03:31,000
"You must not harm him," said Guanyin.

55
5538:05:11,000 --> 5582:26:51,000
[g@"He's my pet wolf.

56
5582:28:31,000 --> 5646:18:31,000
He escaped from Heaven."@g]

57
5646:20:11,000 --> 5721:58:31,000
[g@The bodhisattva looked at the demon.

58
5722:00:11,000 --> 5799:13:31,000
"Return to your true form!"@g]

59
5799:15:11,000 --> 5953:16:51,000
Light sparkled, and the demon turned into a huge wolf.

60
5953:18:31,000 --> 6055:55:11,000
Guanyin climbed onto the wolf's back.

61
6055:56:51,000 --> 6151:41:51,000
She looked at the wolf's neck and then at Wukong.

62
6151:43:31,000 --> 6240:03:31,000
"Give me the bells, Wukong."

63
6240:05:11,000 --> 6391:45:11,000
"What bells?" Wukong held the bells behind his back.

64
6391:46:51,000 --> 6507:43:31,000
"My wolf wears a set of three bells," said Guanyin.

65
6507:45:11,000 --> 6552:16:51,000
[g@"I know you have them.

66
6552:18:31,000 --> 6637:38:31,000
You could not have defeated the wolf without them."@g]

67
6637:40:11,000 --> 6752:11:51,000
Wukong shrugged. "I have no idea what you'reâ€”"

68
6752:13:31,000 --> 6836:23:31,000
[g@"Hand them over," said Guanyin.

69
6836:25:11,000 --> 6961:31:51,000
"Or I'll recite the Tight Headband spell."@g]

70
6961:33:31,000 --> 7043:43:31,000
[g@"There's no need for that!" cried the monkey.

71
7043:45:11,000 --> 7095:20:11,000
"I was just joking!"@g]

72
7095:21:51,000 --> 7190:25:11,000
Grinning sheepishly, he handed over the bells.

73
7190:26:51,000 --> 7456:45:11,000
Guanyin tied the bells around the wolf's neck and then rode up into the sky.

74
7456:46:51,000 --> 7571:31:51,000
Back at the palace, the king and queen were reunited.

75
7571:33:31,000 --> 7723:55:11,000
"Thank you for rescuing the queen, Sun Wukong," said the king.

76
7723:56:51,000 --> 7916:28:31,000
"Tonight we will hold a feast to thank you and [n@your companions," said the queen.

77
7916:30:11,000 --> 8035:00:11,000
That night the royal banquet hall was filled with people.

78
8035:01:51,000 --> 8303:00:11,000
Servants carried trays filled with rice, vegetables, mushrooms, [n@noodles, tofu, dumplings, and other food.

79
8303:01:51,000 --> 8432:45:11,000
Bajie ate everything in front of him.

80
8432:46:51,000 --> 8559:43:31,000
"Would you like more steamed buns?" asked a servant.

81
8559:45:11,000 --> 8644:38:31,000
"You don't need to ask," said the pig.

82
8644:40:11,000 --> 8896:06:51,000
"Just put food in front of me, and I'll eat it!"
