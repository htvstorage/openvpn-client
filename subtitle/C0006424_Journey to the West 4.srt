00:00:11,306.66699999999946 --> 207:28:31,306.6670000553131
When the other students went to bed that night, Wukong stayed awake.

2
207:30:11,306.6670000553131 --> 346:01:51,306.6670000553131
At three o'clock in the morning, he crept quietly through the dark temple.

3
346:03:31,306.6670000553131 --> 476:53:31,306.6670000553131
He entered Subodhi's room.

4
476:55:11,306.6670000553131 --> 593:21:51,306.6670000553131
"Wukong, what are you doing here?" asked the sage.

5
593:23:31,306.6670000553131 --> 698:40:11,306.66699981689453
"I understood your secret message," said the monkey.

6
698:41:51,306.66699981689453 --> 780:56:51,306.66699981689453
"You hit me on the head three times.

7
780:58:31,306.66699981689453 --> 874:03:31,306.66699981689453
That meant you wanted me to visit you at three o'clock.

8
874:05:11,306.66699981689453 --> 957:43:31,306.66699981689453
Now will you teach me how to live forever?"

9
957:45:11,306.66699981689453 --> 1202:56:51,306.66699981689453
Subodhi smiled. "I knew you were a worthy student. Come closer."

10
1202:58:31,306.66699981689453 --> 1298:16:51,306.66699981689453
Subodhi whispered into Wukong's ear.

11
1298:18:31,306.66699981689453 --> 1461:58:31,306.66699981689453
The sage whispered prayers as well as secret [n@formulas about the universe and nature.

12
1462:00:11,306.66699981689453 --> 1677:36:51,306.66699981689453
As the monkey listened to his teacher's [n@words, powerful light filled the room.

13
1677:38:31,306.66699981689453 --> 1853:53:31,306.66699981689453
Now Wukong knew how to live forever!

14
1853:55:11,306.66699981689453 --> 1999:50:11,306.66699981689453
For the next few years, Wukong meditated and practiced the secret formulas.

15
1999:51:51,306.66699981689453 --> 2122:18:31,306.66699981689453
While the other students slept at night, Wukong stayed up.

16
2122:20:11,306.66699981689453 --> 2330:16:51,306.66699981689453
Soon his mind and body were powerful, and he could change shape or size.

17
2330:18:31,306.66699981689453 --> 2624:28:31,306.66699981689453
He could turn into other animals and soar through the sky on clouds.

18
2624:30:11,306.66699981689453 --> 2749:13:31,306.66699981689453
One day all the students were sitting outside.

19
2749:15:11,306.66699981689453 --> 2868:51:51,306.66699981689453
"Wukong," said one student. "You have been busy lately."

20
2868:53:31,306.66699981689453 --> 2997:38:31,306.66699981689453
"It's true," said another student. "What have you been doing?"

21
2997:40:11,306.66699981689453 --> 3132:01:51,306.66699981689453
"I've been meditating and practicing secret formulas," said Wukong.

22
3132:03:31,306.66699981689453 --> 3229:33:31,306.66699981689453
"Secret formulas?" said the first student.

23
3229:35:11,306.66699981689453 --> 3310:08:31,306.66699981689453
[g@Everyone looked very interested.

24
3310:10:11,306.66699981689453 --> 3394:25:11,306.66699981689453
They leaned in closer to Wukong.@g]

25
3394:26:51,306.66699981689453 --> 3532:41:51,306.66699981689453
"Yes," said the monkey. "Our master told them to me."

26
3532:43:31,306.66699981689453 --> 3644:23:31,306.66699981689453
"He did?" said a student. "You must be special.

27
3644:25:11,306.66699981689453 --> 3716:20:11,306.66699981689453
[g@He doesn't tell everyone those formulas.

28
3716:21:51,306.66699981689453 --> 3767:31:51,306.66699981689453
What did he teach you?"@g]

29
3767:33:31,306.66699981689453 --> 3888:00:11,306.66699981689453
Wukong smiled. "He taught me how to live forever.

30
3888:01:51,306.66699981689453 --> 3997:11:51,306.66699981689453
He also taught me how to change into other things."

31
3997:13:31,306.66699981689453 --> 4080:53:31,306.66699981689453
"Show us what you can do," said the student.

32
4080:55:11,306.66699981689453 --> 4136:20:11,306.66699981689453
[g@Wukong stood up.

33
4136:21:51,306.66699981689453 --> 4249:50:11,306.66699981689453
He muttered a quick spell and made a sign with his hands.@g]

34
4249:51:51,306.66699981689453 --> 4363:25:11,306.66699981689453
Suddenlyâ€”[i@zap!@i] The monkey was gone.

35
4363:26:51,306.66699981689453 --> 4473:36:51,306.66699981689453
An enormous pine tree stood in his place.

36
4473:38:31,306.66699981689453 --> 4547:58:31,306.66699981689453
[g@Wukong's voice came from the tree.

37
4548:00:11,306.66699981689453 --> 4596:38:31,306.66699981689453
"What do you think?"@g]

38
4596:40:11,306.66699981689453 --> 4673:45:11,306.66699981689453
The students clapped and cheered.

39
4673:46:51,306.66699981689453 --> 4750:06:51,306.66699981689453
"That's amazing!" said one.

40
4750:08:31,306.66699981689453 --> 4867:48:31,306.66699981689453
"The monkey is truly powerful!" said another.

41
4867:50:11,306.66699981689453 --> 4995:13:31,306.66699981689453
[g@The noise disturbed Subodhi.

42
4995:15:11,306.66699981689453 --> 5113:10:11,306.66699981689453
He ran outside and saw the enormous pine tree.@g]

43
5113:11:51,306.66699981689453 --> 5199:51:51,306.66699981689453
"What's going on out here?" he shouted.

44
5199:53:31,306.66699981689453 --> 5256:50:11,306.66699981689453
[g@Everyone stopped cheering.

45
5256:51:51,306.66699981689453 --> 5350:20:11,306.66699981689453
Wukong quickly turned back into himself.@g]

46
5350:21:51,306.66699981689453 --> 5439:40:11,306.66699981689453
Subodhi's eyes flashed with anger.

47
5439:41:51,306.66699981689453 --> 5547:31:51,306.66699981689453
"Everyone but Wukong, go inside!" he yelled.

48
5547:33:31,306.66699981689453 --> 5761:30:11,306.66699981689453
Subodhi waited for the other students to leave.

49
5761:31:51,306.66699981689453 --> 5890:26:51,306.66699981689453
"I taught you the secret formulas so you could live forever," said the sage.

50
5890:28:31,306.66699981689453 --> 5964:00:11,306.66699981689453
"Not so you could show off!"

51
5964:01:51,306.66699981689453 --> 6065:40:11,306.66699981689453
"I'm sorry," said Wukong. "Iâ€”"

52
6065:41:51,306.66699981689453 --> 6121:23:31,306.66699981689453
[g@Subodhi kept talking.

53
6121:25:11,306.66699981689453 --> 6213:15:11,306.66699981689453
"Now all of the students have seen what you can do.@g]

54
6213:16:51,306.66699981689453 --> 6285:30:11,306.66699981689453
They will want to know how to do it too!

55
6285:31:51,306.66699981689453 --> 6384:21:51,306.66699981689453
If you don't tell them, they might harm you.

56
6384:23:31,306.66699981689453 --> 6488:51:51,306.66699981689453
[g@It's not safe for you to stay here anymore.

57
6488:53:31,306.66699981689453 --> 6555:21:51,306.66699981689453
You must go."@g]

58
6555:23:31,306.66699981689453 --> 6633:13:31,306.66699981689453
[g@Wukong started to cry.

59
6633:15:11,306.66699981689453 --> 6717:18:31,306.66699981689453
"But, Master! Where will I go?"@g]

60
6717:20:11,306.66699981689453 --> 6805:28:31,306.66699981689453
"Go back home," said Subodhi.

61
6805:30:11,306.66699981689453 --> 6905:01:51,306.66699981689453
"But you taught me so many things!" said the monkey.

62
6905:03:31,306.66699981689453 --> 6967:38:31,306.66699981689453
"I must repay you first."

63
6967:40:11,306.66699981689453 --> 7063:10:11,306.66699981689453
"You don't need to repay me," said Subodhi.

64
7063:11:51,306.66699981689453 --> 7140:05:11,306.66699981689453
"Just try to stay out of trouble."

65
7140:06:51,306.66699981689453 --> 7302:16:51,306.66699981689453
The sage looked at Wukong for a moment.

66
7302:18:31,306.66699981689453 --> 7429:50:11,306.66699981689453
Then he said, "I can see that you will do evil things someday.

67
7429:51:51,306.66699981689453 --> 7549:21:51,306.66699981689453
Don't tell anyone you were my student. Now go."

68
7549:23:31,306.66699981689453 --> 7731:56:51,306.66699981689453
Wukong hung his head. "Good-bye, Master."

69
7731:58:31,306.66699981689453 --> 7943:51:51,306.66699981689453
He leaped onto a cloud and left.

70
7943:53:31,306.66699981689453 --> 8169:21:51,306.66699981689453
After a short journey, Wukong arrived at the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

71
8169:23:31,306.66699981689453 --> 8311:50:11,306.66699981689453
"I have returned!" he called.

72
8311:51:51,306.66699981689453 --> 8395:15:11,306.66699981689453
[g@The gibbon ran to him.

73
8395:16:51,306.66699981689453 --> 8575:41:51,306.66699981689453
"Your Majesty! Something terrible has happened!"@g]
