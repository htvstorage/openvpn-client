1
00:00:11,307 --> 00:00:18,776
When the other students went to bed that night, Wukong stayed awake.

2
00:00:18,777 --> 00:00:23,764
At three o'clock in the morning, he crept quietly through the dark temple.

3
00:00:23,765 --> 00:00:28,475
He entered Subodhi's room.

4
00:00:28,476 --> 00:00:32,668
"Wukong, what are you doing here?" asked the sage.

5
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,459
"I understood your secret message," said the monkey.

6
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,421
"You hit me on the head three times.

7
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:42,773
That meant you wanted me to visit you at three o'clock.

8
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:45,785
Now will you teach me how to live forever?"

9
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:54,613
Subodhi smiled. "I knew you were a worthy student. Come closer."

10
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:58,045
Subodhi whispered into Wukong's ear.

11
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:03,938
The sage whispered prayers as well as secret formulas about the universe and nature.

12
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:11,701
As the monkey listened to his teacher's words, powerful light filled the room.

13
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:18,047
Now Wukong knew how to live forever!

14
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:23,301
For the next few years, Wukong meditated and practiced the secret formulas.

15
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:27,710
While the other students slept at night, Wukong stayed up.

16
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:35,197
Soon his mind and body were powerful, and he could change shape or size.

17
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:45,788
He could turn into other animals and soar through the sky on clouds.

18
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:50,279
One day all the students were sitting outside.

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,586
"Wukong," said one student. "You have been busy lately."

20
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:59,222
"It's true," said another student. "What have you been doing?"

21
00:01:59,223 --> 00:02:04,060
"I've been meditating and practicing secret formulas," said Wukong.

22
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:07,571
"Secret formulas?" said the first student.

23
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:10,472
Everyone looked very interested.

24
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:13,506
They leaned in closer to Wukong.

25
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:18,484
"Yes," said the monkey. "Our master told them to me."

26
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:22,505
"He did?" said a student. "You must be special.

27
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:25,095
He doesn't tell everyone those formulas.

28
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:26,938
What did he teach you?"

29
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,275
Wukong smiled. "He taught me how to live forever.

30
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:35,206
He also taught me how to change into other things."

31
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:38,219
"Show us what you can do," said the student.

32
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,215
Wukong stood up.

33
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:44,301
He muttered a quick spell and made a sign with his hands.

34
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:48,390
Suddenlyâ€”zap! The monkey was gone.

35
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:52,357
An enormous pine tree stood in his place.

36
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:55,034
Wukong's voice came from the tree.

37
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:56,786
"What do you think?"

38
00:02:56,787 --> 00:02:59,562
The students clapped and cheered.

39
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:02,311
"That's amazing!" said one.

40
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:06,548
"The monkey is truly powerful!" said another.

41
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:11,135
The noise disturbed Subodhi.

42
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:15,381
He ran outside and saw the enormous pine tree.

43
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:18,502
"What's going on out here?" he shouted.

44
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:20,553
Everyone stopped cheering.

45
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:23,919
Wukong quickly turned back into himself.

46
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,135
Subodhi's eyes flashed with anger.

47
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:31,018
"Everyone but Wukong, go inside!" he yelled.

48
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:38,721
Subodhi waited for the other students to leave.

49
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:43,363
"I taught you the secret formulas so you could live forever," said the sage.

50
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:46,011
"Not so you could show off!"

51
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:49,671
"I'm sorry," said Wukong. "Iâ€”"

52
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:51,677
Subodhi kept talking.

53
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:54,984
"Now all of the students have seen what you can do.

54
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,585
They will want to know how to do it too!

55
00:03:57,586 --> 00:04:01,144
If you don't tell them, they might harm you.

56
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:04,906
It's not safe for you to stay here anymore.

57
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:07,300
You must go."

58
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:10,103
Wukong started to cry.

59
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:13,130
"But, Master! Where will I go?"

60
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:16,304
"Go back home," said Subodhi.

61
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:19,888
"But you taught me so many things!" said the monkey.

62
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:22,142
"I must repay you first."

63
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,581
"You don't need to repay me," said Subodhi.

64
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:28,350
"Just try to stay out of trouble."

65
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:34,189
The sage looked at Wukong for a moment.

66
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,781
Then he said, "I can see that you will do evil things someday.

67
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:43,084
Don't tell anyone you were my student. Now go."

68
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:49,657
Wukong hung his head. "Good-bye, Master."

69
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:57,286
He leaped onto a cloud and left.

70
00:04:57,287 --> 00:05:05,404
After a short journey, Wukong arrived at the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

71
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:10,533
"I have returned!" he called.

72
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:13,536
The gibbon ran to him.

73
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:20,032
"Your Majesty! Something terrible has happened!"
