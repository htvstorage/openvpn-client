1
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:19,541
Wukong and Guanyin flew over the ocean and back to the wide river.

2
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:25,973
From the sky Guanyin called, "Dragon! Come out of the river at once.

3
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:31,335
The Tang Monk is here!"

4
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:36,027
The dragon rose from the river and bowed.

5
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:39,611
[g@"Bodhisattva," he said, "I'm sorry.

6
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:42,980
I didn't realize the monk had arrived.@g]

7
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:45,136
[g@I was trying to rest.

8
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:48,298
A nasty monkey was . . ."@g]

9
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:55,273
The dragon stopped talking when he saw [n@Wukong next to Guanyin. "That's him!"

10
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:59,370
[g@"This is Sun Wukong," said Guanyin.

11
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:02,837
"He is traveling with the Tang Monk."@g]

12
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:06,531
"The monkey didn't tell me that," said the dragon.

13
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:10,751
"I even asked him who he was, and he didn't answer."

14
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:14,191
[g@"I know," said Guanyin.

15
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:16,727
She shot Wukong a look.@g]

16
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:20,992
"From now on, you must tell people who you are.

17
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:25,675
There are others waiting for you too."

18
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:28,647
"Okay," said Wukong.

19
00:01:28,648 --> 00:01:31,596
Guanyin looked back at the dragon.

20
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:38,374
"You will carry the Tang Monk to the Western Paradise."

21
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:42,659
Sparkling light surrounded the dragon.

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,218
When the light faded, a horse stood where the dragon had been.

23
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,538
It looked exactly like the Tang Monk's horse.

24
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:59,229
After Guanyin left, Wukong led the horse to the Tang Monk.

25
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,310
"You got the horse back!" said the monk.

26
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:06,116
[g@"No," said Wukong. "Guanyin was here.

27
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:08,526
She turned the dragon into a horse.@g]

28
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:13,756
He's supposed to come with us."

29
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:17,847
The Tang Monk fell to his knees and bowed.

30
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:22,427
Wukong laughed. "Stand up, Master.

31
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:26,074
The bodhisattva is back on Mount Potalaka by now."

32
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:28,874
"Do you need a ride?" called a voice.

33
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,059
[g@Wukong spun around.

34
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,449
A boat had arrived next to the shore.@g]

35
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,853
"I will take you across the river," said the boatman.

36
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:52,596
The Tang Monk stepped onto the boat, and Wukong followed with the horse.

37
00:02:52,597 --> 00:02:57,284
The boatman didn't speak as he rowed them across the river.

38
00:02:57,285 --> 00:03:06,286
On the other side of the river, the monkey led the horse onto the shore.

39
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:09,887
The Tang Monk stepped out of the boat.

40
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:14,991
When he turned to thank the boatman, the boat was gone.

41
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:19,660
Wukong laughed when he saw how confused the monk looked.

42
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:25,431
"He was the river's spirit," the monkey explained.

43
00:03:25,432 --> 00:03:32,941
The monk and the monkey continued their [n@journey over hills and across plains.

44
00:03:32,942 --> 00:03:38,614
"How long will it take to reach the Western Paradise?" [n@the Tang Monk asked one afternoon.

45
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:42,452
[g@"A long, long time," said Wukong.

46
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:46,153
"We've barely started our journey."@g]

47
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:50,093
They walked some more until they reached a Buddhist monastery.

48
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:53,576
"Let's stop here for the night," said Wukong.

49
00:03:53,577 --> 00:04:00,607
"We're Buddhists. The priests inside will gladly give us [n@some food and a place to sleep."

50
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:06,088
Later that evening the Tang Monk and Wukong ate a meal with the priests.

51
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:11,107
When the head priest heard where the Tang Monk was going, he was excited.

52
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:16,019
"You are going to get the True Scriptures," said the priest.

53
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,204
[g@"That is quite an honor.

54
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:21,544
How did the bodhisattva choose you?"@g]

55
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:26,017
"She said that only a true believer could [n@make the journey," said the Tang Monk.

56
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:31,617
"I tried on a robe, and she saw that I was a true believer."

57
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:35,319
"Do you have the robe with you?" asked the priest.

58
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,566
"Yes," said the Tang Monk. "It's a Buddhist treasure."

59
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:47,472
He reached into his bag and pulled out the robe.

60
00:04:47,473 --> 00:04:50,248
[g@The priest's eyes sparkled.

61
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,438
"May I hold it?"@g]

62
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,130
The Tang Monk handed the robe to the priest.

63
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:58,615
[g@The priest admired it for a moment.

64
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:01,346
"May I borrow it, just for tonight?"@g]

65
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:03,502
[g@The Tang Monk hesitated.

66
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:07,796
"I guess that would be okay."@g]

67
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:13,431
Late that night the priest was awake, gazing at the robe.

68
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:17,518
[g@"I can't return this robe.

69
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,072
I must have it!"@g]
