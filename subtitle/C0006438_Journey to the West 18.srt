1
00:00:11,134 --> 233:31:51,134
Wukong and Guanyin flew over the ocean and back to the wide river.

2
233:33:31,134 --> 412:11:51,134
From the sky Guanyin called, "Dragon! Come out of the river at once.

3
412:13:31,134 --> 561:08:31,134
The Tang Monk is here!"

4
561:10:11,134 --> 691:28:31,134
The dragon rose from the river and bowed.

5
691:30:11,134 --> 791:01:51,134
[g@"Bodhisattva," he said, "I'm sorry.

6
791:03:31,134 --> 884:36:51,134
I didn't realize the monk had arrived.@g]

7
884:38:31,134 --> 944:30:11,134
[g@I was trying to rest.

8
944:31:51,134 --> 1032:20:11,134
A nasty monkey was . . ."@g]

9
1032:21:51,134 --> 1226:05:11,134
The dragon stopped talking when he saw [n@Wukong next to Guanyin. "That's him!"

10
1226:06:51,134 --> 1339:53:31,134
[g@"This is Sun Wukong," said Guanyin.

11
1339:55:11,134 --> 1436:11:51,134
"He is traveling with the Tang Monk."@g]

12
1436:13:31,134 --> 1538:48:31,134
"The monkey didn't tell me that," said the dragon.

13
1538:50:11,134 --> 1656:01:51,134
"I even asked him who he was, and he didn't answer."

14
1656:03:31,134 --> 1751:35:11,134
[g@"I know," said Guanyin.

15
1751:36:51,134 --> 1822:01:51,134
She shot Wukong a look.@g]

16
1822:03:31,134 --> 1940:30:11,134
"From now on, you must tell people who you are.

17
1940:31:51,134 --> 2070:35:11,134
There are others waiting for you too."

18
2070:36:51,134 --> 2153:08:31,134
"Okay," said Wukong.

19
2153:10:11,134 --> 2235:03:31,134
Guanyin looked back at the dragon.

20
2235:05:11,134 --> 2423:20:11,134
"You will carry the Tang Monk to the Western Paradise."

21
2423:21:51,134 --> 2542:21:51,134
Sparkling light surrounded the dragon.

22
2542:23:31,134 --> 2669:00:11,134
When the light faded, a horse stood where the dragon had been.

23
2669:01:51,134 --> 2816:46:51,134
It looked exactly like the Tang Monk's horse.

24
2816:48:31,134 --> 3002:38:31,134
After Guanyin left, Wukong led the horse to the Tang Monk.

25
3002:40:11,134 --> 3088:13:31,134
"You got the horse back!" said the monk.

26
3088:15:11,134 --> 3193:56:51,134
[g@"No," said Wukong. "Guanyin was here.

27
3193:58:31,134 --> 3260:53:31,134
She turned the dragon into a horse.@g]

28
3260:55:11,134 --> 3406:10:11,134
He's supposed to come with us."

29
3406:11:51,134 --> 3519:48:31,134
The Tang Monk fell to his knees and bowed.

30
3519:50:11,134 --> 3647:01:51,134
Wukong laughed. "Stand up, Master.

31
3647:03:31,134 --> 3748:20:11,134
The bodhisattva is back on Mount Potalaka by now."

32
3748:21:51,134 --> 3826:06:51,134
"Do you need a ride?" called a voice.

33
3826:08:31,134 --> 3886:48:31,134
[g@Wukong spun around.

34
3886:50:11,134 --> 3980:58:31,134
A boat had arrived next to the shore.@g]

35
3981:00:11,134 --> 4158:51:51,134
"I will take you across the river," said the boatman.

36
4158:53:31,134 --> 4485:03:31,134
The Tang Monk stepped onto the boat, and Wukong followed with the horse.

37
4485:05:11,134 --> 4615:16:51,134
The boatman didn't speak as he rowed them across the river.

38
4615:18:31,134 --> 4865:20:11,134
On the other side of the river, the monkey led the horse onto the shore.

39
4865:21:51,134 --> 4965:21:51,134
The Tang Monk stepped out of the boat.

40
4965:23:31,134 --> 5107:08:31,134
When he turned to thank the boatman, the boat was gone.

41
5107:10:11,134 --> 5236:50:11,134
Wukong laughed when he saw how confused the monk looked.

42
5236:51:51,134 --> 5397:08:31,134
"He was the river's spirit," the monkey explained.

43
5397:10:11,134 --> 5605:45:11,134
The monk and the monkey continued their [n@journey over hills and across plains.

44
5605:46:51,134 --> 5763:20:11,134
"How long will it take to reach the Western Paradise?" [n@the Tang Monk asked one afternoon.

45
5763:21:51,134 --> 5869:56:51,134
[g@"A long, long time," said Wukong.

46
5869:58:31,134 --> 5972:45:11,134
"We've barely started our journey."@g]

47
5972:46:51,134 --> 6082:11:51,134
They walked some more until they reached a Buddhist monastery.

48
6082:13:31,134 --> 6178:56:51,134
"Let's stop here for the night," said Wukong.

49
6178:58:31,134 --> 6374:15:11,134
"We're Buddhists. The priests inside will gladly give us [n@some food and a place to sleep."

50
6374:16:51,134 --> 6526:30:11,134
Later that evening the Tang Monk and Wukong ate a meal with the priests.

51
6526:31:51,134 --> 6665:55:11,134
When the head priest heard where the Tang Monk was going, he was excited.

52
6665:56:51,134 --> 6802:21:51,134
"You are going to get the True Scriptures," said the priest.

53
6802:23:31,134 --> 6863:03:31,134
[g@"That is quite an honor.

54
6863:05:11,134 --> 6955:50:11,134
How did the bodhisattva choose you?"@g]

55
6955:51:51,134 --> 7080:05:11,134
"She said that only a true believer could [n@make the journey," said the Tang Monk.

56
7080:06:51,134 --> 7235:38:31,134
"I tried on a robe, and she saw that I was a true believer."

57
7235:40:11,134 --> 7338:28:31,134
"Do you have the robe with you?" asked the priest.

58
7338:30:11,134 --> 7512:00:11,134
"Yes," said the Tang Monk. "It's a Buddhist treasure."

59
7512:01:51,134 --> 7676:03:31,134
He reached into his bag and pulled out the robe.

60
7676:05:11,134 --> 7753:10:11,134
[g@The priest's eyes sparkled.

61
7753:11:51,134 --> 7814:00:11,134
"May I hold it?"@g]

62
7814:01:51,134 --> 7916:33:31,134
The Tang Monk handed the robe to the priest.

63
7916:35:11,134 --> 7985:35:11,134
[g@The priest admired it for a moment.

64
7985:36:51,134 --> 8061:26:51,134
"May I borrow it, just for tonight?"@g]

65
8061:28:31,134 --> 8121:20:11,134
[g@The Tang Monk hesitated.

66
8121:21:51,134 --> 8240:36:51,134
"I guess that would be okay."@g]

67
8240:38:31,134 --> 8397:08:31,134
Late that night the priest was awake, gazing at the robe.

68
8397:10:11,134 --> 8510:40:11,134
[g@"I can't return this robe.

69
8510:41:51,134 --> 8664:56:51,134
I must have it!"@g]
