00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:18,106
"Why won't Wukong help us?" the horse asked Bajie.

2
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:19,950
[g@The pig sighed.

3
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:23,398
"He told us not to look for him if we needed help.@g]

4
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,325
Plus I kept telling Master to use the Tight Headband spell.

5
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:30,745
I'll bet the monkey is really mad at me."

6
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:33,789
"That doesn't matter now," said the horse.

7
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,663
"You must get Wukong to come back."

8
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:43,612
Bajie hesitated for a moment and then leaped onto a cloud.

9
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:48,503
He soared through the sky and soon arrived at the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

10
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:52,398
He found Wukong sitting beside the big waterfall.

11
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,034
[g@Other monkeys and apes were nearby.

12
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:57,425
They held swords and spears.@g]

13
00:00:57,426 --> 00:01:01,358
They stared at Bajie silently.

14
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,408
"Hello, Wukong," said the pig. "This is a lovely mountain."

15
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:11,908
Wukong scowled. "What are you doing here, Bajie?"

16
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,449
The pig looked at the ground.

17
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,733
"The Tang Monk would like you to come back," he mumbled.

18
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:23,477
"Well, that's too bad," said Wukong, standing up.

19
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:25,049
[g@"He told me to leave.

20
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:31,176
I'll never help him again."@g]

21
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:34,116
[g@"Please come back," said Bajie.

22
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:36,383
"We all miss you."@g]

23
00:01:36,384 --> 00:01:39,283
"I don't miss [i@you@i]," said Wukong.

24
00:01:39,284 --> 00:01:42,982
"You told Master to use the Tight Headband spell.

25
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:48,598
I should take out my iron bar and clobber you!"

26
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,400
[g@Bajie forced a laugh.

27
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:54,323
"I was just joking, Wukong.@g]

28
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:59,863
I knew you were really just protecting Master."

29
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:03,260
[g@"It wasn't funny," said Wukong.

30
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:10,427
"That spell really hurts!"@g]

31
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:12,534
The pig began to cry.

32
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:14,387
[g@"Please come back.

33
00:02:14,388 --> 00:02:18,349
The Tang Monk is in danger—big danger.@g]

34
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,539
[g@A monster turned him into a tiger.

35
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,470
And Wujing was captured."@g]

36
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:26,825
Wukong shrugged.

37
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:30,646
"Just tell the monster that you're friends with me, the Monkey King.

38
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:36,458
He'll be scared and leave all of you alone."

39
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:40,519
"Oh, I did tell him about you," Bajie lied.

40
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,582
[g@"Really?" Wukong leaned closer.

41
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,666
"What did he say?"@g]

42
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,621
[g@Bajie bit his lip.

43
00:02:48,622 --> 00:02:54,286
"He laughed and said that you're a tiny little coward."@g]

44
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:57,922
Wukong's eyes blazed with fury.

45
00:02:57,923 --> 00:03:08,628
"He will regret saying that! Let's go, Bajie!"

46
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:13,714
The monster sat in the dining hall, still [n@disguised as a handsome young man.

47
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:17,145
He was eating a meal with the king and the queen.

48
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:25,203
A servant came in and handed a note to the young man.

49
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,692
The young man read the note and stood up.

50
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:32,310
"I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I must go."

51
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:35,415
He ran out of the dining hall.

52
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:40,257
From behind a pillar, the servant watched the man leave.

53
00:03:40,258 --> 00:03:46,061
Light sparkled, and the servant turned into Bajie.

54
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:50,912
The pig giggled. "The monster is going to be so surprised!"

55
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:55,735
The young man ran outside and turned back into a monster.

56
00:03:55,736 --> 00:04:00,721
He flew through the air and returned to his pagoda.

57
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:03,404
He burst through the door in a panic.

58
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:07,284
Then he saw Princess Hundred Flowers and relaxed.

59
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:12,594
"Oh, my sweet!" he cried. "I was so scared.

60
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:15,747
I thought I had lost you forever!"

61
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:20,472
"Why did you think that?" asked the princess.

62
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:24,089
The monster sighed. "I got a note.

63
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:30,476
It said there was a monkey here, and he was trying to destroy my pagoda."

64
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:34,647
"A monkey was here earlier," said the princess.

65
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:37,033
[g@"Really?" said the monster.

66
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:39,039
He looked around.@g]

67
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,654
[g@"He didn't destroy the pagoda.

68
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:43,820
What did he want?"@g]

69
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:45,920
The princess hesitated.

70
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:50,465
"You're not going to be happy about this," she said.

71
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:54,376
"But he freed the purple spirit you had captured."

72
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:59,825
The monster looked angry. "How dare he—"

73
00:04:59,826 --> 00:05:04,364
"The monkey did something else too," said the princess.

74
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:07,599
"What did he do?" asked the monster.

75
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,732
[g@There was a flash of light.

76
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:14,440
Suddenly Wukong stood before the monster.@g]

77
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:16,167
[g@The monkey smiled.

78
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:22,993
"I freed the princess too!"@g]
