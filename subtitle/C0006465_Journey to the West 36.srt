"Why won't Wukong help us?" the horse asked Bajie.

2
190:00:11,266.6670000553131 --> 241:11:51,266.6670000553131
[g@The pig sighed.

3
241:13:31,266.6670000553131 --> 336:58:31,266.6670000553131
"He told us not to look for him if we needed help.@g]

4
337:00:11,266.6670000553131 --> 446:03:31,266.6670000553131
Plus I kept telling Master to use the Tight Headband spell.

5
446:05:11,266.6670000553131 --> 541:03:31,266.6670000553131
I'll bet the monkey is really mad at me."

6
541:05:11,266.6670000553131 --> 625:36:51,266.66699981689453
"That doesn't matter now," said the horse.

7
625:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 705:26:51,266.66699981689453
"You must get Wukong to come back."

8
705:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 898:28:31,266.66699981689453
Bajie hesitated for a moment and then leaped onto a cloud.

9
898:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1034:20:11,266.66699981689453
He soared through the sky and soon arrived at the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

10
1034:21:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1142:31:51,266.66699981689453
He found Wukong sitting beside the big waterfall.

11
1142:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1215:45:11,266.66699981689453
[g@Other monkeys and apes were nearby.

12
1215:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1282:10:11,266.66699981689453
They held swords and spears.@g]

13
1282:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1391:25:11,266.66699981689453
They stared at Bajie silently.

14
1391:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1531:41:51,266.66699981689453
"Hello, Wukong," said the pig. "This is a lovely mountain."

15
1531:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1684:28:31,266.66699981689453
Wukong scowled. "What are you doing here, Bajie?"

16
1684:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1755:03:31,266.66699981689453
The pig looked at the ground.

17
1755:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1901:50:11,266.66699981689453
"The Tang Monk would like you to come back," he mumbled.

18
1901:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2005:50:11,266.66699981689453
"Well, that's too bad," said Wukong, standing up.

19
2005:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2049:30:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"He told me to leave.

20
2049:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2219:41:51,266.66699981689453
I'll never help him again."@g]

21
2219:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2301:21:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"Please come back," said Bajie.

22
2301:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2364:20:11,266.66699981689453
"We all miss you."@g]

23
2364:21:51,266.66699981689453 --> 2444:53:31,266.66699981689453
"I don't miss [i@you@i]," said Wukong.

24
2444:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2547:38:31,266.66699981689453
"You told Master to use the Tight Headband spell.

25
2547:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2703:38:31,266.66699981689453
I should take out my iron bar and clobber you!"

26
2703:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2781:28:31,266.66699981689453
[g@Bajie forced a laugh.

27
2781:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2862:40:11,266.66699981689453
"I was just joking, Wukong.@g]

28
2862:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3016:33:31,266.66699981689453
I knew you were really just protecting Master."

29
3016:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3110:55:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"It wasn't funny," said Wukong.

30
3110:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3310:00:11,266.66699981689453
"That spell really hurts!"@g]

31
3310:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3368:31:51,266.66699981689453
The pig began to cry.

32
3368:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3420:00:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"Please come back.

33
3420:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3530:03:31,266.66699981689453
The Tang Monk is in danger—big danger.@g]

34
3530:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3590:53:31,266.66699981689453
[g@A monster turned him into a tiger.

35
3590:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3700:05:11,266.66699981689453
And Wujing was captured."@g]

36
3700:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3765:30:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong shrugged.

37
3765:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3871:38:31,266.66699981689453
"Just tell the monster that you're friends with me, the Monkey King.

38
3871:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4033:05:11,266.66699981689453
He'll be scared and leave all of you alone."

39
4033:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4145:53:31,266.66699981689453
"Oh, I did tell him about you," Bajie lied.

40
4145:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4230:58:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"Really?" Wukong leaned closer.

41
4231:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4288:51:51,266.66699981689453
"What did he say?"@g]

42
4288:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4370:56:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Bajie bit his lip.

43
4370:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4528:18:31,266.66699981689453
"He laughed and said that you're a tiny little coward."@g]

44
4528:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4629:18:31,266.66699981689453
Wukong's eyes blazed with fury.

45
4629:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4926:41:51,266.66699981689453
"He will regret saying that! Let's go, Bajie!"

46
4926:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5067:58:31,266.66699981689453
The monster sat in the dining hall, still [n@disguised as a handsome young man.

47
5068:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5163:16:51,266.66699981689453
He was eating a meal with the king and the queen.

48
5163:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5387:06:51,266.66699981689453
A servant came in and handed a note to the young man.

49
5387:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5484:01:51,266.66699981689453
The young man read the note and stood up.

50
5484:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5584:31:51,266.66699981689453
"I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I must go."

51
5584:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5670:46:51,266.66699981689453
He ran out of the dining hall.

52
5670:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5805:16:51,266.66699981689453
From behind a pillar, the servant watched the man leave.

53
5805:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5966:30:11,266.66699981689453
Light sparkled, and the servant turned into Bajie.

54
5966:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6101:15:11,266.66699981689453
The pig giggled. "The monster is going to be so surprised!"

55
6101:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6235:13:31,266.66699981689453
The young man ran outside and turned back into a monster.

56
6235:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6373:43:31,266.66699981689453
He flew through the air and returned to his pagoda.

57
6373:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6448:15:11,266.66699981689453
He burst through the door in a panic.

58
6448:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6556:01:51,266.66699981689453
Then he saw Princess Hundred Flowers and relaxed.

59
6556:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6703:31:51,266.66699981689453
"Oh, my sweet!" he cried. "I was so scared.

60
6703:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6791:06:51,266.66699981689453
I thought I had lost you forever!"

61
6791:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6922:21:51,266.66699981689453
"Why did you think that?" asked the princess.

62
6922:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7022:50:11,266.66699981689453
The monster sighed. "I got a note.

63
7022:51:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7200:15:11,266.66699981689453
It said there was a monkey here, and he was trying to destroy my pagoda."

64
7200:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7316:06:51,266.66699981689453
"A monkey was here earlier," said the princess.

65
7316:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7382:23:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"Really?" said the monster.

66
7382:25:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7438:06:51,266.66699981689453
He looked around.@g]

7438:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7510:45:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"He didn't destroy the pagoda.

7510:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7570:55:11,266.66699981689453
What did he want?"@g]

69
7570:56:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7629:15:11,266.66699981689453
The princess hesitated.

70
7629:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7755:30:11,266.66699981689453
"You're not going to be happy about this," she said.

71
7755:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7864:08:31,266.66699981689453
"But he freed the purple spirit you had captured."

72
7864:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8015:30:11,266.66699981689453
The monster looked angry. "How dare he—"

73
8015:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 8141:35:11,266.66699981689453
"The monkey did something else too," said the princess.

74
8141:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 8231:26:51,266.66699981689453
"What did he do?" asked the monster.

75
8231:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8318:28:31,266.66699981689453
[g@There was a flash of light.

8318:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8421:28:31,266.66699981689453
Suddenly Wukong stood before the monster.@g]

8421:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 8469:26:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The monkey smiled.

78
8469:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 8659:03:31,266.66699981689453
"I freed the princess too!"@g]
