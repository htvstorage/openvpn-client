1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,790
Five hundred years passed.

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:19,454
Wukong stayed trapped under the mountain.

3
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:25,086
A thick layer of moss covered the monkey.

4
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:31,048
One day Buddha sat in the Thunderclap Monastery in the Western Paradise.

5
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:33,919
He was talking to his students.

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,322
"The people in the East, in the Tang Empire, need our help," said Buddha.

7
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:43,952
"They lie, cheat, and steal.

8
00:00:43,953 --> 00:00:48,244
They are greedy and constantly fighting."

9
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:51,663
He held up a bundle of scrolls.

10
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:54,544
"These are the True Scriptures.

11
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:58,875
They will teach the people in the East to act better."

12
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:01,529
"Wonderful," said one student.

13
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,844
"Let's bring the scriptures to the Tang Empire."

14
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:06,898
Buddha shook his head.

15
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,625
"No," he said.

16
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:15,424
"A true believer—a monk—needs to come here to get them.

17
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:20,169
Will anyone go to the East to find a worthy monk?"

18
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,565
Guanyin stepped forward.

19
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:28,399
"I will go."

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,568
The Tang Emperor smiled as his head monk read to a small group of people.

21
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:38,341
The monk was reading old religious texts.

22
00:01:38,342 --> 00:01:40,957
A woman interrupted the monk.

23
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:45,345
"Why are you reading those old texts?" she asked.

24
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:50,268
"Don't you know about the True Scriptures?"

25
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:52,122
The emperor stood up.

26
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:55,983
"How dare you interrupt my—"

27
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:59,439
"It's okay," said the monk.

28
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:08,639
He walked over to the woman.

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,674
"What are the True Scriptures?"

30
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:14,640
The woman looked at the monk carefully.

31
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:17,739
"They contain many lessons.

32
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,738
People who learn the lessons never have to suffer again."

33
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,101
"Do you have them here?" asked the monk.

34
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:28,225
"No," said the woman.

35
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:32,244
"They are with Buddha in the Western Paradise.

36
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:36,859
Someone must travel to the Thunderclap Monastery to get them.

37
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,750
But only a true believer may make the journey."

38
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:45,544
She took a robe out of her bag.

39
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:49,823
"Put this on."

40
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:52,423
The monk put on the robe.

41
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:55,472
Beams of light shone from it.

42
00:02:55,473 --> 00:02:57,698
The emperor gasped.

43
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:02,066
"You are a true believer," said the woman.

44
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:05,748
"Will you make the journey?"

45
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:10,505
"Yes," said the monk, looking down at the glowing robe.

46
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:12,652
"It will be an honor."

47
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:17,008
"The journey will be very difficult," said the woman.

48
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,929
"Wide rivers and steep mountains will block your path.

49
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,980
Fierce creatures and evil demons will try to attack you.

50
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:34,116
But don't fear—you will have help from me."

51
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:38,458
Suddenly the room filled with blinding light.

52
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,928
The woman rose into the air and changed form.

53
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:46,753
"It's the bodhisattva Guanyin!" someone cried.

54
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:50,296
The emperor and everyone else in the room bowed.

55
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:57,416
Guanyin rose higher and then disappeared.

56
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:00,924
The next morning there was a huge feast.

57
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:04,167
The Tang Emperor sat next to the monk.

58
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:09,725
"Your journey will help our empire greatly," said the emperor.

59
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:14,328
"No longer will our people suffer or treat each other badly.

60
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,509
From now on, I will think of you as my brother.

61
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,781
You will be called the Tang Monk."

62
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:25,394
"Thank you, Your Majesty," said the Tang Monk.

63
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:29,394
"How long will the journey take?" asked the emperor.

64
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:37,476
"I will return in a few years," said the monk.

65
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:42,268
Later that day the Tang Monk got ready for his journey.

66
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:48,760
He put the special robe into a bag.

67
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:53,340
He put dried foods into another bag.

68
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:57,328
A big crowd gathered to say good-bye.

69
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:02,115
"Good luck, my brother," said the Tang Emperor.

70
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:11,592
The Tang Monk climbed onto a horse and rode toward the West.

71
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:17,301
He had traveled for over a month when he came to a big mountain.

72
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:21,480
Slowly his horse walked up a steep trail.

73
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:25,193
"I have a bad feeling," said the Tang Monk.

74
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:27,412
He looked around uneasily.

75
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:30,689
"I hope there aren't any demons here."

76
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:40,512
Suddenly a voice boomed, "Who is walking on my mountain?"
