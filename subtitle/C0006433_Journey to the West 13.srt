1
00:00:11,000 --> 133:03:31,000
[g@Five hundred years passed.

2
133:05:11,000 --> 234:50:11,000
Wukong stayed trapped under the mountain.@g]

3
234:51:51,000 --> 391:16:51,000
A thick layer of moss covered the monkey.

4
391:18:31,000 --> 556:53:31,000
One day Buddha sat in the Thunderclap Monastery in the Western Paradise.

5
556:55:11,000 --> 636:38:31,000
He was talking to his students.

6
636:40:11,000 --> 814:30:11,000
"The people in the East, in the Tang Empire, need our help," said Buddha.

7
814:31:51,000 --> 915:20:11,000
[g@"They lie, cheat, and steal.

8
915:21:51,000 --> 1034:33:31,000
They are greedy and constantly fighting."@g]

9
1034:35:11,000 --> 1129:31:51,000
[g@He held up a bundle of scrolls.

10
1129:33:31,000 --> 1209:33:31,000
"These are the True Scriptures.@g]

11
1209:35:11,000 --> 1329:51:51,000
They will teach the people in the East to act better."

12
1329:53:31,000 --> 1403:35:11,000
"Wonderful," said one student.

13
1403:36:51,000 --> 1495:40:11,000
"Let's bring the scriptures to the Tang Empire."

14
1495:41:51,000 --> 1552:43:31,000
[g@Buddha shook his head.

15
1552:45:11,000 --> 1628:28:31,000
"No," he said.@g]

16
1628:30:11,000 --> 1789:33:31,000
"A true believer—a monk—needs to come here to get them.

17
1789:35:11,000 --> 1921:21:51,000
Will anyone go to the East to find a worthy monk?"

18
1921:23:31,000 --> 2015:41:51,000
[g@Guanyin stepped forward.

19
2015:43:31,000 --> 2149:58:31,000
"I will go."@g]

20
2150:00:11,000 --> 2321:20:11,000
The Tang Emperor smiled as his head monk read to a small group of people.

21
2321:21:51,000 --> 2426:08:31,000
The monk was reading old religious texts.

22
2426:10:11,000 --> 2498:48:31,000
A woman interrupted the monk.

23
2498:50:11,000 --> 2620:41:51,000
"Why are you reading those old texts?" she asked.

24
2620:43:31,000 --> 2757:26:51,000
"Don't you know about the True Scriptures?"

25
2757:28:31,000 --> 2808:56:51,000
[g@The emperor stood up.

26
2808:58:31,000 --> 2916:11:51,000
"How dare you interrupt my—"@g]

27
2916:13:31,000 --> 3012:11:51,000
[g@"It's okay," said the monk.

28
3012:13:31,000 --> 3267:45:11,000
He walked over to the woman.@g]

29
3267:46:51,000 --> 3324:16:51,000
"What are the True Scriptures?"

30
3324:18:31,000 --> 3434:26:51,000
[g@The woman looked at the monk carefully.

31
3434:28:31,000 --> 3520:31:51,000
"They contain many lessons.@g]

32
3520:33:31,000 --> 3659:23:31,000
People who learn the lessons never have to suffer again."

33
3659:25:11,000 --> 3752:48:31,000
"Do you have them here?" asked the monk.

34
3752:50:11,000 --> 3811:48:31,000
[g@"No," said the woman.

35
3811:50:11,000 --> 3923:26:51,000
"They are with Buddha in the Western Paradise.@g]

36
3923:28:31,000 --> 4051:38:31,000
Someone must travel to the Thunderclap Monastery to get them.

37
4051:40:11,000 --> 4187:30:11,000
But only a true believer may make the journey."

38
4187:31:51,000 --> 4292:53:31,000
[g@She took a robe out of her bag.

39
4292:55:11,000 --> 4411:45:11,000
"Put this on."@g]

40
4411:46:51,000 --> 4483:58:31,000
The monk put on the robe.

41
4484:00:11,000 --> 4568:40:11,000
[g@Beams of light shone from it.

42
4568:41:51,000 --> 4630:30:11,000
The emperor gasped.@g]

43
4630:31:51,000 --> 4751:50:11,000
[g@"You are a true believer," said the woman.

44
4751:51:51,000 --> 4854:06:51,000
"Will you make the journey?"@g]

45
4854:08:31,000 --> 4986:15:11,000
"Yes," said the monk, looking down at the glowing robe.

46
4986:16:51,000 --> 5045:53:31,000
"It will be an honor."

47
5045:55:11,000 --> 5166:53:31,000
"The journey will be very difficult," said the woman.

48
5166:55:11,000 --> 5303:35:11,000
"Wide rivers and steep mountains will block your path.

49
5303:36:51,000 --> 5499:26:51,000
Fierce creatures and evil demons will try to attack you.

50
5499:28:31,000 --> 5642:06:51,000
But don't fear—you will have help from me."

51
5642:08:31,000 --> 5762:43:31,000
Suddenly the room filled with blinding light.

52
5762:45:11,000 --> 5886:53:31,000
The woman rose into the air and changed form.

53
5886:55:11,000 --> 5993:08:31,000
"It's the bodhisattva Guanyin!" someone cried.

54
5993:10:11,000 --> 6091:33:31,000
The emperor and everyone else in the room bowed.

55
6091:35:11,000 --> 6289:20:11,000
Guanyin rose higher and then disappeared.

56
6289:21:51,000 --> 6386:46:51,000
The next morning there was a huge feast.

57
6386:48:31,000 --> 6476:51:51,000
The Tang Emperor sat next to the monk.

58
6476:53:31,000 --> 6631:15:11,000
"Your journey will help our empire greatly," said the emperor.

59
6631:16:51,000 --> 6759:06:51,000
"No longer will our people suffer or treat each other badly.

60
6759:08:31,000 --> 6875:15:11,000
From now on, I will think of you as my brother.

61
6875:16:51,000 --> 6966:08:31,000
You will be called the Tang Monk."

62
6966:10:11,000 --> 7066:30:11,000
"Thank you, Your Majesty," said the Tang Monk.

63
7066:31:51,000 --> 7177:36:51,000
"How long will the journey take?" asked the emperor.

64
7177:38:31,000 --> 7402:06:51,000
"I will return in a few years," said the monk.

65
7402:08:31,000 --> 7535:13:31,000
Later that day the Tang Monk got ready for his journey.

66
7535:15:11,000 --> 7715:33:31,000
[g@He put the special robe into a bag.

67
7715:35:11,000 --> 7842:46:51,000
He put dried foods into another bag.@g]

68
7842:48:31,000 --> 7953:33:31,000
A big crowd gathered to say good-bye.

69
7953:35:11,000 --> 8086:31:51,000
"Good luck, my brother," said the Tang Emperor.

70
8086:33:31,000 --> 8349:46:51,000
The Tang Monk climbed onto a horse and rode toward the West.

71
8349:48:31,000 --> 8508:21:51,000
He had traveled for over a month when he came to a big mountain.

72
8508:23:31,000 --> 8624:26:51,000
Slowly his horse walked up a steep trail.

73
8624:28:31,000 --> 8727:35:11,000
[g@"I have a bad feeling," said the Tang Monk.

74
8727:36:51,000 --> 8789:13:31,000
He looked around uneasily.@g]

75
8789:15:11,000 --> 8880:15:11,000
"I hope there aren't any demons here."

76
8880:16:51,000 --> 9153:06:51,000
Suddenly a voice boomed, "Who is walking on my mountain?"
