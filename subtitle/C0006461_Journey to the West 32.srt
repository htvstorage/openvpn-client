Lady Whitebone sat by the road and sniffed the air again.

2
191:50:11,133.3329999446869 --> 358:21:51,133.3329999446869
"The Tang Monk has some powerful companions," she said.

3
358:23:31,133.3329999446869 --> 602:15:11,133.33300018310547
"I need a disguise."

602:16:51,133.33300018310547 --> 675:21:51,133.33300018310547
Bajie dropped the bags.

5
675:23:31,133.33300018310547 --> 744:30:11,133.33300018310547
[g@"I'm tired and hungry.

6
744:31:51,133.33300018310547 --> 852:26:51,133.33300018310547
Let's stop for lunch."@g]

7
852:28:31,133.33300018310547 --> 1056:55:11,133.33300018310547
Using his magic sight, Wukong saw a peach orchard thousands of miles away.

8
1056:56:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1138:21:51,133.33300018310547
"I'll be back in a minute," he said.

9
1138:23:31,133.33300018310547 --> 1307:40:11,133.33300018310547
Soon after the monkey had left, a young woman came down the road.

10
1307:41:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1385:30:11,133.33300018310547
She held out a bowl.

11
1385:31:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1472:55:11,133.33300018310547
[g@"Are you the Tang Monk?" she asked.

12
1472:56:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1543:06:51,133.33300018310547
"I have food for you."@g]

13
1543:08:31,133.33300018310547 --> 1685:01:51,133.33300018310547
Bajie reached for the bowl. "Thank you!"

14
1685:03:31,133.33300018310547 --> 1812:50:11,133.33300018310547
"Don't eat that!" Wukong was flying fast, back to the group.

15
1812:51:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1946:23:31,133.33300018310547
He dropped all the peaches and pulled out his iron bar.

16
1946:25:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2037:10:11,133.33300018310547
[i@Wham!@i] He struck at the young woman.

17
2037:11:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2203:48:31,133.33300018310547
But before he hit her, she disappeared.

18
2203:50:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2288:38:31,133.33300018310547
"Why did you do that?" cried the Tang Monk.

19
2288:40:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2382:50:11,133.33300018310547
"You're a human, Master," said Wukong.

20
2382:51:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2506:48:31,133.33300018310547
"You couldn't see that the woman was really a spirit who wanted to harm you.

21
2506:50:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2593:50:11,133.33300018310547
Unfortunately she got away."

22
2593:51:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2681:18:31,133.33300018310547
[g@"Why are you so cruel?" asked the monk.

23
2681:20:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2752:11:51,133.33300018310547
"She was giving us food."@g]

24
2752:13:31,133.33300018310547 --> 2921:50:11,133.33300018310547
"It's not food," said the monkey.

25
2921:51:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3097:46:51,133.33300018310547
"See?" He held up the bowl, which was filled with worms.

26
3097:48:31,133.33300018310547 --> 3189:40:11,133.33300018310547
"Don't believe Wukong," said Bajie.

27
3189:41:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3288:33:31,133.33300018310547
"He used magic to turn the food into worms."

28
3288:35:11,133.33300018310547 --> 3418:23:31,133.33300018310547
The pig looked at the ground where the woman had been and shook his head.

29
3418:25:11,133.33300018310547 --> 3552:13:31,133.33300018310547
"Wukong hit her so hard, there isn't anything left of her."

30
3552:15:11,133.33300018310547 --> 3776:36:51,133.33300018310547
"That's ridiculous," said Wukong. "Iâ€”ahh!"

31
3776:38:31,133.33300018310547 --> 3965:00:11,133.33300018310547
The monkey rolled on the ground as the Tang Monk [n@recited the Tight Headband spell.

32
3965:01:51,133.33300018310547 --> 4108:01:51,133.33300018310547
Bajie laughed. "I didn't know you could do that, Master."

33
4108:03:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4220:56:51,133.33300018310547
Just then an old woman came down the road.

34
4220:58:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4410:26:51,133.33300018310547
The monk stopped reciting the spell, and Wukong stood up.

35
4410:28:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4522:31:51,133.33300018310547
"I'm looking for my daughter," said the woman.

36
4522:33:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4638:00:11,133.33300018310547
"She was bringing food to the Tang Monk."

37
4638:01:51,133.33300018310547 --> 4723:01:51,133.33300018310547
"Oh no," said the Tang Monk.

38
4723:03:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4796:05:11,133.33300018310547
Bajie stepped forward.

39
4796:06:51,133.33300018310547 --> 4903:05:11,133.33300018310547
"You should ask this monkey what happened to your daughter."

40
4903:06:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5088:46:51,133.33300018310547
Wukong looked at the old woman closely for a moment.

41
5088:48:31,133.33300018310547 --> 5198:00:11,133.33300018310547
[g@Then he took out his iron bar and swung.

42
5198:01:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5278:58:31,133.33300018310547
But again he missed.@g]

43
5279:00:11,133.33300018310547 --> 5392:36:51,133.33300018310547
"She got away again!" cried Wukong.

44
5392:38:31,133.33300018310547 --> 5510:40:11,133.33300018310547
"He killed another innocent person!" cried the pig.

45
5510:41:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5603:36:51,133.33300018310547
"Master, recite the spell!"

46
5603:38:31,133.33300018310547 --> 5698:23:31,133.33300018310547
[g@The Tang Monk recited the spell again.

47
5698:25:11,133.33300018310547 --> 5819:28:31,133.33300018310547
Wukong fell to the ground in pain.@g]

48
5819:30:11,133.33300018310547 --> 5936:55:11,133.33300018310547
"Please stop!" cried the monkey.

49
5936:56:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5989:15:11,133.33300018310547
[g@The Tang Monk stopped.

50
5989:16:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6088:58:31,133.33300018310547
"Don't hurt any more people," he said.@g]

51
6089:00:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6207:53:31,133.33300018310547
"If you do, I'll recite the spell until your head explodes."

52
6207:55:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6320:13:31,133.33300018310547
Just then an old man came down the road.

53
6320:15:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6516:11:51,133.33300018310547
"I'm looking for my wife and daughter," he said.

54
6516:13:31,133.33300018310547 --> 6628:01:51,133.33300018310547
"That's the evil spirit woman again," thought Wukong.

55
6628:03:31,133.33300018310547 --> 6740:48:31,133.33300018310547
"If I don't destroy her, she'll harm the Tang Monk.

56
6740:50:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6907:33:31,133.33300018310547
But if I do hurt her, the monk will make my head explode."

57
6907:35:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7105:23:31,133.33300018310547
Wukong sighed. "I must protect the Tang Monk, no matter what," he thought.

58
7105:25:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7227:25:11,133.33300018310547
[g@Wukong whipped out his iron bar and swung.

59
7227:26:51,133.33300018310547 --> 7301:28:31,133.33300018310547
There was a puff of smoke.@g]

60
7301:30:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7426:18:31,133.33300018310547
When the smoke cleared, a skeleton lay on the ground.

61
7426:20:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7493:45:11,133.33300018310547
[g@"I got her!" cried Wukong.

62
7493:46:51,133.33300018310547 --> 7600:06:51,133.33300018310547
"See? She was an evil skeleton spirit!"@g]

63
7600:08:31,133.33300018310547 --> 7660:58:31,133.33300018310547
The Tang Monk frowned.

64
7661:00:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7796:25:11,133.33300018310547
"Recite the spell again," Bajie said to the monk.

65
7796:26:51,133.33300018310547 --> 7901:51:51,133.33300018310547
"I want you to leave, Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

66
7901:53:31,133.33300018310547 --> 8043:05:11,133.33300018310547
"Master," said the monkey. "I just saved your life."

67
8043:06:51,133.33300018310547 --> 8114:05:11,133.33300018310547
"I don't believe you," said the monk.

68
8114:06:51,133.33300018310547 --> 8207:20:11,133.33300018310547
"Now leave or I'll recite the spell again."

69
8207:21:51,133.33300018310547 --> 8280:08:31,133.33300018310547
[g@Wukong became angry.

70
8280:10:11,133.33300018310547 --> 8370:31:51,133.33300018310547
"If you really want me to leave, I'll leave.@g]

71
8370:33:31,133.33300018310547 --> 8479:48:31,133.33300018310547
But don't come looking for me when you need help!"

72
8479:50:11,133.33300018310547 --> 8758:23:31,133.33300018310547
He leaped into the air and vanished.
