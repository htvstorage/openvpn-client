1
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:18,038
Lady Whitebone sat by the road and sniffed the air again.

2
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:24,034
"The Tang Monk has some powerful companions," she said.

3
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:32,814
"I need a disguise."

4
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:35,446
Bajie dropped the bags.

5
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:37,935
"I'm tired and hungry.

6
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:41,821
Let's stop for lunch."

7
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:49,182
Using his magic sight, Wukong saw a peach orchard thousands of miles away.

8
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:52,114
"I'll be back in a minute," he said.

9
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:58,209
Soon after the monkey had left, a young woman came down the road.

10
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,011
She held out a bowl.

11
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:04,158
"Are you the Tang Monk?" she asked.

12
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,685
"I have food for you."

13
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:11,794
Bajie reached for the bowl. "Thank you!"

14
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:16,395
"Don't eat that!" Wukong was flying fast, back to the group.

15
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:21,203
He dropped all the peaches and pulled out his iron bar.

16
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:24,471
Wham! He struck at the young woman.

17
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:30,470
But before he hit her, she disappeared.

18
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:33,524
"Why did you do that?" cried the Tang Monk.

19
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:36,915
"You're a human, Master," said Wukong.

20
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:41,378
"You couldn't see that the woman was really a spirit who wanted to harm you.

21
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,511
Unfortunately she got away."

22
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:47,660
"Why are you so cruel?" asked the monk.

23
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:50,212
"She was giving us food."

24
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:56,319
"It's not food," said the monkey.

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,653
"See?" He held up the bowl, which was filled with worms.

26
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:05,961
"Don't believe Wukong," said Bajie.

27
00:02:05,962 --> 00:02:09,521
"He used magic to turn the food into worms."

28
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:14,195
The pig looked at the ground where the woman had been and shook his head.

29
00:02:14,196 --> 00:02:19,013
"Wukong hit her so hard, there isn't anything left of her."

30
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:27,091
"That's ridiculous," said Wukong. "Iâ€”ahh!"

31
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:33,873
The monkey rolled on the ground as the Tang Monk recited the Tight Headband spell.

32
00:02:33,874 --> 00:02:39,022
Bajie laughed. "I didn't know you could do that, Master."

33
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:43,087
Just then an old woman came down the road.

34
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:49,909
The monk stopped reciting the spell, and Wukong stood up.

35
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,944
"I'm looking for my daughter," said the woman.

36
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:58,101
"She was bringing food to the Tang Monk."

37
00:02:58,102 --> 00:03:01,162
"Oh no," said the Tang Monk.

38
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:03,792
Bajie stepped forward.

39
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:07,644
"You should ask this monkey what happened to your daughter."

40
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:14,329
Wukong looked at the old woman closely for a moment.

41
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,261
Then he took out his iron bar and swung.

42
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:21,176
But again he missed.

43
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:25,267
"She got away again!" cried Wukong.

44
00:03:25,268 --> 00:03:29,517
"He killed another innocent person!" cried the pig.

45
00:03:29,518 --> 00:03:32,863
"Master, recite the spell!"

46
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:36,275
The Tang Monk recited the spell again.

47
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:40,634
Wukong fell to the ground in pain.

48
00:03:40,635 --> 00:03:44,862
"Please stop!" cried the monkey.

49
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:46,746
The Tang Monk stopped.

50
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:50,336
"Don't hurt any more people," he said.

51
00:03:50,337 --> 00:03:54,617
"If you do, I'll recite the spell until your head explodes."

52
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:58,661
Just then an old man came down the road.

53
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:05,716
"I'm looking for my wife and daughter," he said.

54
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:09,742
"That's the evil spirit woman again," thought Wukong.

55
00:04:09,743 --> 00:04:13,802
"If I don't destroy her, she'll harm the Tang Monk.

56
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:19,805
But if I do hurt her, the monk will make my head explode."

57
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:26,927
Wukong sighed. "I must protect the Tang Monk, no matter what," he thought.

58
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:31,320
Wukong whipped out his iron bar and swung.

59
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:33,986
There was a puff of smoke.

60
00:04:33,987 --> 00:04:38,480
When the smoke cleared, a skeleton lay on the ground.

61
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:40,908
"I got her!" cried Wukong.

62
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:44,737
"See? She was an evil skeleton spirit!"

63
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:46,928
The Tang Monk frowned.

64
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:51,804
"Recite the spell again," Bajie said to the monk.

65
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:55,600
"I want you to leave, Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

66
00:04:55,601 --> 00:05:00,684
"Master," said the monkey. "I just saved your life."

67
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:03,240
"I don't believe you," said the monk.

68
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:06,597
"Now leave or I'll recite the spell again."

69
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,218
Wukong became angry.

70
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:12,472
"If you really want me to leave, I'll leave.

71
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:16,406
But don't come looking for me when you need help!"

72
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:26,435
He leaped into the air and vanished.
