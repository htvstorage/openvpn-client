1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:16,086
Bajie waved his rake at the demon Golden Horn.

2
00:00:16,087 --> 00:00:19,470
"You'll never harm the Tang Monk!" shouted the pig.

3
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:23,217
"My rake is very powerful!"

4
00:00:23,218 --> 00:00:27,846
Bajie rushed toward Golden Horn.

5
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:31,829
But the demon was strong.

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,364
Bajie was knocked out.

7
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:45,195
When he woke up, he was tied up in a dark cave.

8
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:49,742
"Bajie is taking a long time to search the mountain," said the Tang Monk.

9
00:00:49,743 --> 00:00:57,112
"I hope he's okay."

10
00:00:57,113 --> 00:01:00,835
Wukong frowned. "He probably went back to sleep.

11
00:01:00,836 --> 00:01:03,588
I should have followed him again."

12
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:06,324
"Let's keep walking," said Wujing.

13
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:09,173
"We'll find Bajie along the way."

14
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:12,396
"We must stay alert though," said Wukong.

15
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:16,163
"We still don't know if there are any demons on this mountain."

16
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:18,969
The group headed up the mountain.

17
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,645
Soon they heard a voice.

18
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:24,025
"Help me!" cried a man.

19
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:27,082
"Someone is in trouble," said the Tang Monk.

20
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:34,092
He and his companions hurried ahead and found an old monk lying near the road.

21
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,955
"Thank goodness!" cried the old monk.

22
00:01:36,956 --> 00:01:39,297
"You must help me."

23
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:42,831
The Tang Monk got down from his horse.

24
00:01:42,832 --> 00:01:48,097
"Of course we will help you," he said.

25
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:49,885
"Please stand up."

26
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:52,587
"I can't," said the old man.

27
00:01:52,588 --> 00:01:53,938
"My leg is injured.

28
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,620
It hurts terribly."

29
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,614
He started to cry.

30
00:01:58,615 --> 00:02:02,768
"How will I ever get back home?"

31
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:05,464
"Please don't cry," said the Tang Monk.

32
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:06,912
"We will help you.

33
00:02:06,913 --> 00:02:08,931
How did your leg get hurt?"

34
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:12,718
"A tiger attacked me," said the old monk.

35
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,429
Wukong looked suspiciously at the man.

36
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,502
"He isn't really a monk," he thought.

37
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:22,071
"I'm sure he wants to harm Master.

38
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:25,538
But I can't tell Master that—he won't believe me."

39
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,913
"Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

40
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:33,478
"Please carry this poor monk down the mountain."

41
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,181
Wukong walked over and picked up the old monk.

42
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:39,777
"Ouch!" cried the monk.

43
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:43,006
"Be careful, Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

44
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:46,749
"His leg is hurt badly."

45
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,532
The group continued along the road.

46
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:52,403
Wukong carried the injured monk.

47
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:58,613
He walked slowly, letting the Tang Monk and Wujing go ahead.

48
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:02,383
"I know you're really a demon," the monkey whispered.

49
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:06,058
"And I know you want to eat the Tang Monk."

50
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:09,632
"I don't know what you're talking about," said the monk.

51
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:13,735
"I'm just a simple monk who was attacked by a tiger."

52
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:17,883
Wukong laughed. "Do you know who I am?

53
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:20,318
I am Sun Wukong.

54
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,574
Heaven's entire army couldn't defeat me.

55
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:27,139
You're going to wish you'd never tried to harm the Tang Monk."

56
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,328
As Wukong talked, he felt a heavy weight pressing down on him.

57
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,824
He glanced up and realized an entire mountain was balanced on top of his head.

58
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:40,338
The monkey laughed again.

59
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:44,265
"So you're going to use magic tricks to trap me under a mountain?

60
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:49,667
Well, let me tell you—Buddha himself once trapped me under a mountain.

61
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:52,438
And I was able to lift it."

62
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,287
Wukong felt more weight.

63
00:03:55,288 --> 00:03:58,826
Now he had two mountains on top of him.

64
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:01,428
He walked more slowly.

65
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:05,571
"This still isn't enough weight to stop me," he said.

66
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:10,712
"Now that the Tang Monk isn't around, I should clobber you with my iron bar."

67
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:14,076
Suddenly the old monk vanished.

68
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:18,053
A third mountain appeared on top of the first two.

69
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:24,188
Wukong's knees buckled, and all three mountains crashed down on top of him.

70
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:26,586
The monkey was trapped.

71
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:29,205
The old monk appeared again.

72
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:35,979
There was a flash of light as he changed back into his demon form.

73
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,020
Golden Horn laughed with delight.

74
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:43,222
"Wukong was the most powerful of these travelers.

75
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:46,812
It will be easy to defeat Wujing.

76
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:55,264
Tonight I will dine on the Tang Monk!"
