Bajie waved his rake at the demon Golden Horn.

133:53:31,266.66699999570847 --> 227:51:51,266.6670000553131
"You'll never harm the Tang Monk!" shouted the pig.

3
227:53:31,266.6670000553131 --> 331:56:51,266.6670000553131
"My rake is very powerful!"

4
331:58:31,266.6670000553131 --> 460:31:51,266.6670000553131
[g@Bajie rushed toward Golden Horn.

5
460:33:31,266.6670000553131 --> 571:10:11,266.6670000553131
But the demon was strong.@g]

571:11:51,266.6670000553131 --> 669:21:51,266.66699981689453
[g@Bajie was knocked out.

7
669:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 942:26:51,266.66699981689453
When he woke up, he was tied up in a dark cave.@g]

8
942:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1068:45:11,266.66699981689453
"Bajie is taking a long time to search the mountain," said the Tang Monk.

9
1068:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1273:28:31,266.66699981689453
"I hope he's okay."

10
1273:30:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1376:53:31,266.66699981689453
Wukong frowned. "He probably went back to sleep.

11
1376:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 1453:21:51,266.66699981689453
I should have followed him again."

12
1453:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1529:21:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"Let's keep walking," said Wujing.

13
1529:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1608:30:11,266.66699981689453

1608:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1698:01:51,266.66699981689453
"We must stay alert though," said Wukong.

15
1698:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1802:40:11,266.66699981689453
"We still don't know if there are any demons on this mountain."

16
1802:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 1880:36:51,266.66699981689453
[g@The group headed up the mountain.

1880:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 1954:56:51,266.66699981689453
Soon they heard a voice.@g]

18
1954:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2021:03:31,266.66699981689453
"Help me!" cried a man.

19
2021:05:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2105:58:31,266.66699981689453
"Someone is in trouble," said the Tang Monk.

20
2106:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2300:41:51,266.66699981689453
He and his companions hurried ahead and [n@found an old monk lying near the road.

21
2300:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2380:13:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"Thank goodness!" cried the old monk.

22
2380:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2445:16:51,266.66699981689453
"You must help me."@g]

2445:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2543:26:51,266.66699981689453
The Tang Monk got down from his horse.

24
2543:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2689:43:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"Of course we will help you," he said.

25
2689:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2739:23:31,266.66699981689453
"Please stand up."@g]

26
2739:25:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2814:26:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"I can't," said the old man.

27
2814:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2851:58:31,266.66699981689453
"My leg is injured.

28
2852:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 2898:41:51,266.66699981689453
It hurts terribly."@g]

2898:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 2981:51:51,266.66699981689453
[g@He started to cry.

30
2981:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3097:15:11,266.66699981689453
"How will I ever get back home?"@g]

31
3097:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3172:08:31,266.66699981689453
"Please don't cry," said the Tang Monk.

32
3172:10:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3212:21:51,266.66699981689453
[g@"We will help you.

3212:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3268:26:51,266.66699981689453
How did your leg get hurt?"@g]

34
3268:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3373:38:31,266.66699981689453
"A tiger attacked me," said the old monk.

35
3373:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3476:43:31,266.66699981689453
Wukong looked suspiciously at the man.

36
3476:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3562:05:11,266.66699981689453
[g@"He isn't really a monk," he thought.

37
3562:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3633:26:51,266.66699981689453
"I'm sure he wants to harm Master.@g]

38
3633:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 3729:45:11,266.66699981689453
But I can't tell Master that—he won't believe me."

39
3729:46:51,266.66699981689453 --> 3795:43:31,266.66699981689453
"Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

40
3795:45:11,266.66699981689453 --> 3950:18:31,266.66699981689453
"Please carry this poor monk down the mountain."

41
3950:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4053:10:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong walked over and picked up the old monk.

42
4053:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4125:16:51,266.66699981689453
"Ouch!" cried the monk.

43
4125:18:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4214:58:31,266.66699981689453
[g@"Be careful, Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

44
4215:00:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4318:56:51,266.66699981689453
"His leg is hurt badly."@g]

4318:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 4396:15:11,266.66699981689453
[g@The group continued along the road.

46
4396:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4476:00:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong carried the injured monk.@g]

47
4476:01:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4648:30:11,266.66699981689453
He walked slowly, letting the Tang Monk and Wujing go ahead.

48
4648:31:51,266.66699981689453 --> 4753:13:31,266.66699981689453
"I know you're really a demon," the monkey whispered.

49
4753:15:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4855:18:31,266.66699981689453
"And I know you want to eat the Tang Monk."

50
4855:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 4954:35:11,266.66699981689453
"I don't know what you're talking about," said the monk.

51
4954:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5068:33:31,266.66699981689453
"I'm just a simple monk who was attacked by a tiger."

52
5068:35:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5183:46:51,266.66699981689453
Wukong laughed. "Do you know who I am?

53
5183:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5251:25:11,266.66699981689453
[g@I am Sun Wukong.

54
5251:26:51,266.66699981689453 --> 5341:51:51,266.66699981689453
Heaven's entire army couldn't defeat me.@g]

55
5341:53:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5440:53:31,266.66699981689453
You're going to wish you'd never tried to harm the Tang Monk."

56
5440:55:11,266.66699981689453 --> 5585:01:51,266.66699981689453
As Wukong talked, he felt a heavy weight pressing down on him.

57
5585:03:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5737:41:51,266.66699981689453
He glanced up and realized an entire mountain [n@was balanced on top of his head.

58
5737:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5807:31:51,266.66699981689453
The monkey laughed again.

59
5807:33:31,266.66699981689453 --> 5916:36:51,266.66699981689453
"So you're going to use magic tricks to trap me under a mountain?

60
5916:38:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6066:40:11,266.66699981689453
Well, let me tell you—Buddha himself once trapped me under a mountain.

61
6066:41:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6143:38:31,266.66699981689453
And I was able to lift it."

62
6143:40:11,266.66699981689453 --> 6222:46:51,266.66699981689453
Wukong felt more weight.

63
6222:48:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6321:05:11,266.66699981689453
[g@Now he had two mountains on top of him.

64
6321:06:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6393:21:51,266.66699981689453
He walked more slowly.@g]

65
6393:23:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6508:26:51,266.66699981689453
"This still isn't enough weight to stop me," he said.

66
6508:28:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6651:15:11,266.66699981689453
"Now that the Tang Monk isn't around, [n@I should clobber you with my iron bar."

67
6651:16:51,266.66699981689453 --> 6744:41:51,266.66699981689453
Suddenly the old monk vanished.

68
6744:43:31,266.66699981689453 --> 6855:10:11,266.66699981689453
A third mountain appeared on top of the first two.

69
6855:11:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7025:35:11,266.66699981689453
Wukong's knees buckled, and all three mountains crashed down on top of him.

70
7025:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7092:11:51,266.66699981689453
The monkey was trapped.

71
7092:13:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7164:56:51,266.66699981689453
The old monk appeared again.

72
7164:58:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7353:06:51,266.66699981689453
There was a flash of light as he changed back into his demon form.

73
7353:08:31,266.66699981689453 --> 7437:35:11,266.66699981689453
Golden Horn laughed with delight.

74
7437:36:51,266.66699981689453 --> 7554:18:31,266.66699981689453
"Wukong was the most powerful of these travelers.

7554:20:11,266.66699981689453 --> 7654:01:51,266.66699981689453
