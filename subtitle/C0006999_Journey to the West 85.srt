1
00:00:11,000 --> 135:20:11,000
Wukong landed on another mountain peak.

2
135:21:51,000 --> 272:23:31,000
[g@"Ah-choo!" The monkey groaned.

3
272:25:11,000 --> 357:55:11,000
"That fire and smoke were awful!@g]

4
357:56:51,000 --> 537:13:31,000
And the sand went right in—ah-ah-choo!—my nose."

5
537:15:11,000 --> 622:45:11,000
He looked at the Demon of Power's mountain.

6
622:46:51,000 --> 707:23:31,000
The fire and smoke were now gone.

7
707:25:11,000 --> 819:01:51,000
[g@Wukong was about to return to that mountain.

8
819:03:31,000 --> 891:41:51,000
But then he hesitated.@g]

9
891:43:31,000 --> 1004:11:51,000
"The demon will just use the same trick again," thought the monkey.

10
1004:13:31,000 --> 1077:50:11,000
"I'll sneak into his cave and look around.

11
1077:51:51,000 --> 1230:40:11,000
Maybe I can find out how he created the fire, smoke, and sand."

12
1230:41:51,000 --> 1491:03:31,000
Wukong turned into a bug and flew back to the demon's mountain.

13
1491:05:11,000 --> 1675:25:11,000
He went into the cave and flew down a long, dark tunnel.

14
1675:26:51,000 --> 1884:26:51,000
He soon found a brightly lit bedroom filled with [n@nice furniture and fancy decorations.

15
1884:28:31,000 --> 1987:23:31,000
[g@In a corner a woman sat in a chair.

16
1987:25:11,000 --> 2052:58:31,000
She was crying.@g]

17
2053:00:11,000 --> 2158:56:51,000
[i@Poof!@i] Wukong turned back into himself.

18
2158:58:31,000 --> 2275:03:31,000
"Oh!" cried the woman. "Wh-who are you?"

19
2275:05:11,000 --> 2368:53:31,000
[g@"My name is Sun Wukong," said the monkey.

20
2368:55:11,000 --> 2417:23:31,000
"Are you the queen?"@g]

21
2417:25:11,000 --> 2476:11:51,000
The woman nodded.

22
2476:13:31,000 --> 2586:36:51,000
"Your husband sent me to rescue you," said Wukong.

23
2586:38:31,000 --> 2677:46:51,000
The queen's face broke into a smile.

24
2677:48:31,000 --> 2718:51:51,000
[g@"Oh, please do!

25
2718:53:31,000 --> 2870:45:11,000
The demon who kidnapped me is horrible—nasty, ugly, smelly!"@g]

26
2870:46:51,000 --> 2923:06:51,000
[g@The queen shivered.

27
2923:08:31,000 --> 3051:20:11,000
"He said he loves me and wants to . . . m-marry me!"@g]

28
3051:21:51,000 --> 3132:28:31,000
The queen started to cry again.

29
3132:30:11,000 --> 3214:50:11,000
[g@"Don't worry, Your Majesty," said Wukong.

30
3214:51:51,000 --> 3261:46:51,000
"I'll defeat the demon.@g]

31
3261:48:31,000 --> 3394:43:31,000
But first I must figure out how he creates the fire, smoke, and sand."

32
3394:45:11,000 --> 3482:45:11,000
"That's simple." The queen sniffed.

33
3482:46:51,000 --> 3534:36:51,000
[g@"He has three bells.

34
3534:38:31,000 --> 3597:23:31,000
The first bell makes fire.@g]

35
3597:25:11,000 --> 3658:55:11,000
[g@The second bell makes smoke.

36
3658:56:51,000 --> 3749:23:31,000
And the third bell makes sand."@g]

37
3749:25:11,000 --> 3827:15:11,000
[g@"I saw the bells," said Wukong.

38
3827:16:51,000 --> 3880:13:31,000
"He wears them around his neck."@g]

39
3880:15:11,000 --> 3922:38:31,000
[g@The monkey smiled.

40
3922:40:11,000 --> 3973:56:51,000
"You wait here, Your Majesty.@g]

41
3973:58:31,000 --> 4053:13:31,000
Tonight I'll steal those bells from the demon.

42
4053:15:11,000 --> 4159:25:11,000
Once I defeat him, I'll come back and rescue you."

43
4159:26:51,000 --> 4375:51:51,000
The monkey turned back into a bug and flew down another tunnel.

44
4375:53:31,000 --> 4483:23:31,000
[g@Soon he found a second bedroom.

45
4483:25:11,000 --> 4572:31:51,000
This one was dark and gloomy.@g]

46
4572:33:31,000 --> 4676:20:11,000
"This must be the demon's bedroom," thought Wukong.

47
4676:21:51,000 --> 4807:43:31,000
"I'll wait here until the demon goes to sleep."

48
4807:45:11,000 --> 4915:13:31,000
He landed on the ceiling and waited.

49
4915:15:11,000 --> 5045:06:51,000
A little while later, the Demon of Power came into the room.

50
5045:08:31,000 --> 5161:06:51,000
Wukong could see the bells tied around the demon's neck.

51
5161:08:31,000 --> 5374:31:51,000
"What a busy day," said the demon. "I'm tired."

52
5374:33:31,000 --> 5493:53:31,000
[g@The demon climbed into bed and closed his eyes.

53
5493:55:11,000 --> 5584:18:31,000
Soon he was snoring loudly.@g]

54
5584:20:11,000 --> 5670:58:31,000
Wukong turned back into himself.

55
5671:00:11,000 --> 5835:21:51,000
He plucked a few of his hairs and turned them into fleas.

56
5835:23:31,000 --> 5949:06:51,000
The fleas landed on the demon's neck and began biting.

57
5949:08:31,000 --> 6046:16:51,000
The demon scratched at his neck and rolled over.

58
6046:18:31,000 --> 6142:13:31,000
[g@Then he scratched some more—and more.

59
6142:15:11,000 --> 6209:15:11,000
Finally the demon sat up.@g]

60
6209:16:51,000 --> 6330:56:51,000
"Why is my neck so itchy?" he said.

61
6330:58:31,000 --> 6386:51:51,000
[g@"Maybe it's these bells.

62
6386:53:31,000 --> 6467:13:31,000
I'll take them off while I sleep."@g]

63
6467:15:11,000 --> 6564:56:51,000
The demon laid the three bells on a table.

64
6564:58:31,000 --> 6661:33:31,000
A few minutes later he was snoring again.

65
6661:35:11,000 --> 6790:35:11,000
The fleas turned back into hairs and returned to Wukong.

66
6790:36:51,000 --> 6933:25:11,000
Next the monkey turned the hairs into three fake bells.

67
6933:26:51,000 --> 7065:45:11,000
He put them on the table and stuck the real bells in his robe.

68
7065:46:51,000 --> 7136:28:31,000
He looked at the sleeping demon.

69
7136:30:11,000 --> 7263:08:31,000
"It's too dangerous to use these bells inside," thought the monkey.

70
7263:10:11,000 --> 7402:41:51,000
"I'll get the demon to come outside, and then I'll fight him."

71
7402:43:31,000 --> 7554:08:31,000
Wukong became invisible and ran back through the tunnel.

72
7554:10:11,000 --> 7673:03:31,000
[g@A guard was sleeping next to the cave entrance.

73
7673:05:11,000 --> 7842:43:31,000
Wukong sneaked past him.@g]

74
7842:45:11,000 --> 7953:35:11,000
Once he was outside, the monkey shouted.

75
7953:36:51,000 --> 8024:38:31,000
[g@"Return the queen right now!

76
8024:40:11,000 --> 8238:53:31,000
If you don't, I'll smash your entire mountain!"@g]
