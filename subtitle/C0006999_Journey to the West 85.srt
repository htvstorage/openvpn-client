1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,872
Wukong landed on another mountain peak.

2
00:00:15,873 --> 00:00:20,806
"Ah-choo!" The monkey groaned.

3
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:23,885
"That fire and smoke were awful!

4
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:30,340
And the sand went right in—ah-ah-choo!—my nose."

5
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:33,419
He looked at the Demon of Power's mountain.

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,466
The fire and smoke were now gone.

7
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:40,485
Wukong was about to return to that mountain.

8
00:00:40,486 --> 00:00:43,101
But then he hesitated.

9
00:00:43,102 --> 00:00:47,151
"The demon will just use the same trick again," thought the monkey.

10
00:00:47,152 --> 00:00:49,802
"I'll sneak into his cave and look around.

11
00:00:49,803 --> 00:00:55,304
Maybe I can find out how he created the fire, smoke, and sand."

12
00:00:55,305 --> 00:01:04,678
Wukong turned into a bug and flew back to the demon's mountain.

13
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:11,315
He went into the cave and flew down a long, dark tunnel.

14
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:18,840
He soon found a brightly lit bedroom filled with nice furniture and fancy decorations.

15
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:22,546
In a corner a woman sat in a chair.

16
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:24,907
She was crying.

17
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:28,722
Poof! Wukong turned back into himself.

18
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:32,902
"Oh!" cried the woman. "Wh-who are you?"

19
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:36,280
"My name is Sun Wukong," said the monkey.

20
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:38,026
"Are you the queen?"

21
00:01:38,027 --> 00:01:40,143
The woman nodded.

22
00:01:40,144 --> 00:01:44,118
"Your husband sent me to rescue you," said Wukong.

23
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:47,400
The queen's face broke into a smile.

24
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:48,879
"Oh, please do!

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,347
The demon who kidnapped me is horrible—nasty, ugly, smelly!"

26
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,232
The queen shivered.

27
00:01:56,233 --> 00:02:00,848
"He said he loves me and wants to . . . m-marry me!"

28
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,769
The queen started to cry again.

29
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,734
"Don't worry, Your Majesty," said Wukong.

30
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,424
"I'll defeat the demon.

31
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:13,210
But first I must figure out how he creates the fire, smoke, and sand."

32
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:16,379
"That's simple." The queen sniffed.

33
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,246
"He has three bells.

34
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:20,506
The first bell makes fire.

35
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,721
The second bell makes smoke.

36
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:25,978
And the third bell makes sand."

37
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,781
"I saw the bells," said Wukong.

38
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,688
"He wears them around his neck."

39
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,215
The monkey smiled.

40
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:34,062
"You wait here, Your Majesty.

41
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:36,916
Tonight I'll steal those bells from the demon.

42
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:40,739
Once I defeat him, I'll come back and rescue you."

43
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:48,531
The monkey turned back into a bug and flew down another tunnel.

44
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:52,402
Soon he found a second bedroom.

45
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:55,611
This one was dark and gloomy.

46
00:02:55,612 --> 00:02:59,348
"This must be the demon's bedroom," thought Wukong.

47
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:04,078
"I'll wait here until the demon goes to sleep."

48
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,948
He landed on the ceiling and waited.

49
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:12,624
A little while later, the Demon of Power came into the room.

50
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:16,800
Wukong could see the bells tied around the demon's neck.

51
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:24,483
"What a busy day," said the demon. "I'm tired."

52
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:28,780
The demon climbed into bed and closed his eyes.

53
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:32,035
Soon he was snoring loudly.

54
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:35,155
Wukong turned back into himself.

55
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:41,073
He plucked a few of his hairs and turned them into fleas.

56
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:45,168
The fleas landed on the demon's neck and began biting.

57
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:48,666
The demon scratched at his neck and rolled over.

58
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:52,120
Then he scratched some more—and more.

59
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,533
Finally the demon sat up.

60
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:58,914
"Why is my neck so itchy?" he said.

61
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:00,927
"Maybe it's these bells.

62
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:03,820
I'll take them off while I sleep."

63
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:07,338
The demon laid the three bells on a table.

64
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:10,816
A few minutes later he was snoring again.

65
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:15,461
The fleas turned back into hairs and returned to Wukong.

66
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:20,603
Next the monkey turned the hairs into three fake bells.

67
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:25,367
He put them on the table and stuck the real bells in his robe.

68
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:27,913
He looked at the sleeping demon.

69
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:32,473
"It's too dangerous to use these bells inside," thought the monkey.

70
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:37,497
"I'll get the demon to come outside, and then I'll fight him."

71
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:42,949
Wukong became invisible and ran back through the tunnel.

72
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,230
A guard was sleeping next to the cave entrance.

73
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:53,338
Wukong sneaked past him.

74
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:57,329
Once he was outside, the monkey shouted.

75
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,887
"Return the queen right now!

76
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:07,600
If you don't, I'll smash your entire mountain!"
