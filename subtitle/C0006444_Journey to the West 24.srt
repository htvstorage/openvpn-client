177:35:11,066.66700005531311 --> 331:00:11,066.66700005531311
"That tiger ate our master," said Bajie. He shrugged.

331:01:51,066.66700005531311 --> 507:51:51,066.66700005531311

794:25:11,066.66699981689453 --> 930:10:11,066.66699981689453
That tiger said he works for a demon, the great king Yellow Wind.

930:11:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1084:38:31,066.66699981689453
The king's cave must be nearby."

1084:40:11,066.66699981689453 --> 1176:23:31,066.66699981689453
The tiger entered his master's cave.

1176:25:11,066.66699981689453 --> 1303:33:31,066.66699981689453
The Tang Monk was slumped over the tiger's shoulder.

1610:06:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1709:23:31,066.66699981689453

Yellow Wind trembled. "A monkey?" he said.

2265:00:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2439:08:31,066.66699981689453
"He must be Sun Wukong—the monkey who caused all that trouble in Heaven!"

2439:10:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2584:05:11,066.66699981689453
"Maybe," said the tiger. "But don't worry.

2584:06:51,066.66699981689453 --> 2689:30:11,066.66699981689453

2778:28:31,066.66699981689453 --> 2894:20:11,066.66699981689453
The tiger patted his stomach and looked at the Tang Monk.

He and that pig might come looking for the monk.

3328:01:51,066.66699981689453 --> 3427:28:31,066.66699981689453
