1
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:14,698
Wukong and Bajie looked all around.

2
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:17,459
But the Tang Monk was gone.

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,983
"That tiger ate our master," said Bajie. He shrugged.

4
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:29,350
"I guess we don't have to protect him anymore. Good-bye, Wukong!"

5
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:32,139
The pig started to walk away.

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,406
But Wukong grabbed him.

7
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:37,254
"You're not leaving!" said the monkey.

8
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:39,665
"We have to save our master.

9
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:44,553
That tiger said he works for a demon, the great king Yellow Wind.

10
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:50,114
The king's cave must be nearby."

11
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:53,417
The tiger entered his master's cave.

12
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:57,995
The Tang Monk was slumped over the tiger's shoulder.

13
00:00:57,996 --> 00:01:02,798
The great king Yellow Wind was sitting on his throne.

14
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:09,030
"Great king!" cried the tiger. "I found the Tang Monk!"

15
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:12,605
The demon king looked surprised and happy.

16
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:17,317
"I have heard that anyone who eats the Tang Monk will live forever.

17
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:20,060
Was the monk alone?"

18
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:23,609
"He had two companions," said the tiger.

19
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,126
"One is a pig.

20
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,997
The other is a monkey."

21
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:32,606
Yellow Wind trembled. "A monkey?" he said.

22
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:38,876
"He must be Sun Wukong—the monkey who caused all that trouble in Heaven!"

23
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:44,094
"Maybe," said the tiger. "But don't worry.

24
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:47,889
I distracted them with a fake tiger skin.

25
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,091
They'll never find us."

26
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:55,263
The tiger patted his stomach and looked at the Tang Monk.

27
00:01:55,264 --> 00:02:00,509
"I'll tell the other demons to start a fire and prepare some spices."

28
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,938
Yellow Wind held up his hand.

29
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,658
"Sun Wukong is powerful.

30
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,875
He and that pig might come looking for the monk.

31
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:14,456
They'll be angry if they find out we ate him.

32
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:17,917
Let's wait until they leave the area.

33
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:21,832
Then we'll be able to enjoy our meal."

34
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:27,698
A small demon ran into the throne room.

35
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:31,027
"Great king!" cried the demon.

36
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:35,844
"There are two strangers outside—a monkey and a pig.

37
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:38,470
They said to hand over the Tang Monk.

38
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:43,535
If we don't, they'll destroy our entire mountain!"

39
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:49,285
"Oh no," moaned Yellow Wind. "This is bad!"

40
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:52,325
"Don't worry, King," said the tiger.

41
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:55,696
"I will get rid of them."

42
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:58,868
The tiger walked out of the throne room.

43
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:04,932
The small demon followed him.

44
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:10,726
Outside the cave there was some yelling and then a crashing sound.

45
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:15,069
A moment later the small demon ran back in.

46
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,412
"Great king, disaster!" he cried.

47
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:20,614
"The tiger is dead!

48
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:23,620
The pig killed him with his rake!"

49
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,405
"What?" cried Yellow Wind.

50
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:31,904
He stood up and grabbed a trident.

51
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:36,906
He puffed out his chest and stomped out of the cave.

52
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:39,176
He saw Wukong.

53
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:45,252
"So you're the monkey who caused all the trouble in Heaven," said Yellow Wind.

54
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:49,078
"Hand over the Tang Monk!" demanded Wukong.

55
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,427
"I didn't know you were so small," said Yellow Wind.

56
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:56,872
"Hit me on the head," said the monkey.

57
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:58,733
"I'll grow bigger."

58
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:01,177
The demon king hesitated.

59
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:04,526
"Go ahead!" said Wukong.

60
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:08,197
Yellow Wind knocked the monkey on the head.

61
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:11,238
Instantly Wukong grew tall.

62
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,760
"Now I'll hit you!" cried Wukong.

63
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:18,161
He swung his iron bar.

64
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:22,596
Crash! The demon king blocked the bar with his trident.

65
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:28,381
Clang! The two fought up and down the side of the mountain.

66
00:04:28,382 --> 00:04:31,137
"I'll use some magic," thought the monkey.

67
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:36,027
He grabbed a handful of hair and blew on it.

68
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:40,467
Dozens of little Wukongs ran toward the demon king.

69
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:46,720
Yellow Wind laughed. "I know a magic trick too!"

70
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:55,003
He looked down and blew three times.

71
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,258
The sky grew dark.

72
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:01,269
A powerful yellow wind whipped across the mountain.

73
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,650
Trees snapped and rocks tumbled.

74
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:09,835
Wukong, Bajie, and all the little Wukongs tumbled down the mountain.

75
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:18,817
They landed at the bottom in a cloud of dust.

76
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:28,764
The demon king went back into his cave and slammed the door shut.
