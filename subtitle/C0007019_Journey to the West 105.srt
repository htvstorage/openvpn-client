00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 171:40:10,933.3329999446869
The travelers walked up the Spirit Mountain.

2
171:41:50,933.3329999446869 --> 374:15:10,933.3329999446869
The mountain's slopes were covered in pine trees, bamboo, and flowers.

3
374:16:50,933.3329999446869 --> 493:36:50,933.3329999446869
Birds sang, and small animals ran by.

4
493:38:30,933.3329999446869 --> 625:06:50,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk stopped walking and turned to his companions.

5
625:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 718:03:30,933.3330001831055
"I want to thank you all," said the monk.

6
718:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 821:20:10,933.3330001831055
"You have helped me to reach the Western Paradise.

7
821:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 911:11:50,933.3330001831055
You saved me from demons countless times.

8
911:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 991:13:30,933.3330001831055
I couldn't have gotten here without you."

9
991:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1060:38:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong laughed.

10
1060:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1128:15:10,933.3330001831055
"You don't need to thank us, Master.@g]

11
1128:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1176:30:10,933.3330001831055
[g@We all helped each other.

12
1176:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1257:56:50,933.3330001831055
You helped me to be good.@g]

13
1257:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1395:58:30,933.3330001831055
Now I will earn forgiveness for the evil things I did long ago."

14
1396:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1434:53:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wujing nodded.

15
1434:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1557:03:30,933.3330001831055
"And I will earn forgiveness [n@for breaking that glass in Heaven."@g]

16
1557:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1705:16:50,933.3330001831055
"I will earn forgiveness for causing trouble in Heaven too," added Bajie.

17
1705:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1784:55:10,933.3330001831055
He waved a hand toward the horse.

18
1784:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1891:06:50,933.3330001831055
"And rememberâ€”that horse is really a dragon.

19
1891:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1995:26:50,933.3330001831055
He accidentally set fire to his father's palace.

20
1995:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2098:13:30,933.3330001831055
He too will earn forgiveness."

21
2098:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2142:28:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong smiled.

22
2142:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2311:40:10,933.3330001831055
"See, Master? We are all thankful."@g]

23
2311:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2516:00:10,933.3330001831055
They continued up the mountain and were soon surrounded by clouds.

24
2516:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2647:31:50,933.3330001831055
Bright light shone from the Thunderclap Monastery above.

25
2647:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2781:30:10,933.3330001831055
The travelers arrived at an enormous gate, where two guards stood.

26
2781:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2997:53:30,933.3330001831055
Beyond the gate the Thunderclap Monastery's towers [n@and arches sparkled with bright light.

27
2997:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3075:21:50,933.3330001831055
"Greetings," said the monk to the guards.

28
3075:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3232:45:10,933.3330001831055
"I am the Tang Monk, and I'm here to receive [n@the True Scriptures from Buddha."

29
3232:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3384:21:50,933.3330001831055
"You may enter," said one of the guards.

30
3384:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3522:36:50,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk and his companions reached a large hall.

31
3522:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3632:50:10,933.3330001831055
Buddha sat at the opposite end of the hall.

32
3632:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3751:26:50,933.3330001831055
Other buddhas and bodhisattvas stood behind him.

33
3751:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3885:26:50,933.3330001831055
Guanyin was standing next to Buddha and smiling.

34
3885:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3957:48:30,933.3330001831055
The travelers bowed.

35
3957:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4049:41:50,933.3330001831055
"Congratulations," said Buddha.

36
4049:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4188:56:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"You have all traveled far and faced many challenges.

37
4188:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4284:11:50,933.3330001831055
You have done well."@g]

38
4284:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4350:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong's heart swelled.

39
4350:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4438:31:50,933.3330001831055
He wiped a tear from his eye.@g]

40
4438:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4498:18:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

41
4498:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4593:26:50,933.3330001831055
"It was an honor to make the journey."@g]

42
4593:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4730:33:30,933.3330001831055
Servants brought a meal to the travelers.

43
4730:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4945:38:30,933.3330001831055
When the travelers were done eating, a guard led them to [n@a large room filled with magical light and mist.

44
4945:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5099:16:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wooden chests lined the walls.

45
5099:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5258:38:30,933.3330001831055
Inside the chests were countless scrolls.@g]

46
5258:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5362:06:50,933.3330001831055
"Marvelous," the Tang Monk murmured.

47
5362:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5514:10:10,933.3330001831055
"The True Scriptures are written on these scrolls," said the guard.

48
5514:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5657:40:10,933.3330001831055
He picked out three scrolls and handed them to the Tang Monk.

49
5657:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5802:35:10,933.3330001831055
Speechless, the monk gazed at the scrolls.

50
5802:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5941:15:10,933.3330001831055
Then he handed them to Wujing and Bajie.

51
5941:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6223:56:50,933.3330001831055
The two spirits carefully wrapped the scrolls and placed them in a bag.

52
6223:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6333:01:50,933.3330001831055
Again the travelers bowed before Buddha.

53
6333:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6483:20:10,933.3330001831055
"Take the True Scriptures back to the Tang Empire," said Buddha.

54
6483:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6609:25:10,933.3330001831055
"Ugh, another long journey," Bajie murmured.

55
6609:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6729:18:30,933.3330001831055
"Stop complaining, Bajie," whispered Wukong.

56
6729:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6778:05:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie whispered back.

57
6778:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6884:03:30,933.3330001831055
"Don't tell me what to do."@g]

58
6884:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7008:55:10,933.3330001831055
"Both of you, stop arguing!" whispered Wujing.

59
7008:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7069:20:10,933.3330001831055
Buddha was still talking.

60
7069:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7244:23:30,933.3330001831055
"The scriptures will teach the people there to [n@be good and to treat each other kindly.

61
7244:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7311:45:10,933.3330001831055
[g@But take good care of the scriptures.

62
7311:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7388:45:10,933.3330001831055
They are extremely valuable.@g]

63
7388:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7573:56:50,933.3330001831055
Once you have delivered them, you shall come back [n@here to receive your rewards."

64
7573:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7671:45:10,933.3330001831055
"Don't worry, Buddha," said Wukong.

65
7671:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7774:48:30,933.3330001831055
"We will protect the scriptures with our lives."

66
7774:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7909:46:50,933.3330001831055
A guard offered to carry the travelers to the Tang Empire.

67
7909:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7976:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

68
7976:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8237:10:10,933.3330001831055
"What a relief!" said Bajie.

69
8237:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8411:51:50,933.3330001831055
The guard recited a spell and then flew out of [n@the monastery with the travelers.

70
8411:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8473:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Buddha turned to Guanyin.

71
8473:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8589:10:10,933.3330001831055
"The Tang Monk and his companions have done well."@g]

72
8589:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8633:03:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Guanyin nodded.

73
8633:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8738:31:50,933.3330001831055
"Wukong especially has learned a lot during the journey.@g]

74
8738:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8802:26:50,933.3330001831055
[g@He isn't violent anymore.

75
8802:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8913:58:30,933.3330001831055
I believe he is now a good Buddhist."@g]

76
8914:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 9025:36:50,933.3330001831055
Just then a messenger ran into the hall.

77
9025:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 9288:51:50,933.3330001831055
"Bodhisattva!" he cried. "We have a problem!"
