1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:17,113
The travelers walked up the Spirit Mountain.

2
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:24,406
The mountain's slopes were covered in pine trees, bamboo, and flowers.

3
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:28,703
Birds sang, and small animals ran by.

4
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:33,437
The Tang Monk stopped walking and turned to his companions.

5
00:00:33,438 --> 00:00:36,783
"I want to thank you all," said the monk.

6
00:00:36,784 --> 00:00:40,501
"You have helped me to reach the Western Paradise.

7
00:00:40,502 --> 00:00:43,736
You saved me from demons countless times.

8
00:00:43,737 --> 00:00:46,617
I couldn't have gotten here without you."

9
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:49,116
[g@Wukong laughed.

10
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:51,550
"You don't need to thank us, Master.@g]

11
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,287
[g@We all helped each other.

12
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:56,219
You helped me to be good.@g]

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,188
Now I will earn forgiveness for the evil things I did long ago."

14
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:02,589
[g@Wujing nodded.

15
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,987
"And I will earn forgiveness [n@for breaking that glass in Heaven."@g]

16
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:12,323
"I will earn forgiveness for causing trouble in Heaven too," added Bajie.

17
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:15,190
He waved a hand toward the horse.

18
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:19,013
"And rememberâ€”that horse is really a dragon.

19
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:22,769
He accidentally set fire to his father's palace.

20
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,469
He too will earn forgiveness."

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,062
[g@Wukong smiled.

22
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:34,153
"See, Master? We are all thankful."@g]

23
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:41,509
They continued up the mountain and were soon surrounded by clouds.

24
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,244
Bright light shone from the Thunderclap Monastery above.

25
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:51,067
The travelers arrived at an enormous gate, where two guards stood.

26
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:58,857
Beyond the gate the Thunderclap Monastery's towers [n@and arches sparkled with bright light.

27
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:01,646
"Greetings," said the monk to the guards.

28
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:07,312
"I am the Tang Monk, and I'm here to receive [n@the True Scriptures from Buddha."

29
00:02:07,313 --> 00:02:12,770
"You may enter," said one of the guards.

30
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:17,747
The Tang Monk and his companions reached a large hall.

31
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:21,715
Buddha sat at the opposite end of the hall.

32
00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:25,985
Other buddhas and bodhisattvas stood behind him.

33
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:30,809
Guanyin was standing next to Buddha and smiling.

34
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,414
The travelers bowed.

35
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:36,722
"Congratulations," said Buddha.

36
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:41,735
[g@"You have all traveled far and faced many challenges.

37
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:45,164
You have done well."@g]

38
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,561
[g@Wukong's heart swelled.

39
00:02:47,562 --> 00:02:50,720
He wiped a tear from his eye.@g]

40
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:52,872
[g@"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

41
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:56,297
"It was an honor to make the journey."@g]

42
00:02:56,298 --> 00:03:01,233
Servants brought a meal to the travelers.

43
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:08,976
When the travelers were done eating, a guard led them to [n@a large room filled with magical light and mist.

44
00:03:08,977 --> 00:03:14,507
[g@Wooden chests lined the walls.

45
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:20,244
Inside the chests were countless scrolls.@g]

46
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:23,969
"Marvelous," the Tang Monk murmured.

47
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,443
"The True Scriptures are written on these scrolls," said the guard.

48
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:34,609
He picked out three scrolls and handed them to the Tang Monk.

49
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:39,826
Speechless, the monk gazed at the scrolls.

50
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:44,818
Then he handed them to Wujing and Bajie.

51
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:54,995
The two spirits carefully wrapped the scrolls and placed them in a bag.

52
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:58,922
Again the travelers bowed before Buddha.

53
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:04,333
"Take the True Scriptures back to the Tang Empire," said Buddha.

54
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:08,872
"Ugh, another long journey," Bajie murmured.

55
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:13,188
"Stop complaining, Bajie," whispered Wukong.

56
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,944
[g@Bajie whispered back.

57
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:18,759
"Don't tell me what to do."@g]

58
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,254
"Both of you, stop arguing!" whispered Wujing.

59
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:25,429
Buddha was still talking.

60
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:31,731
"The scriptures will teach the people there to [n@be good and to treat each other kindly.

61
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:34,156
[g@But take good care of the scriptures.

62
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:36,928
They are extremely valuable.@g]

63
00:04:36,929 --> 00:04:43,595
Once you have delivered them, you shall come back [n@here to receive your rewards."

64
00:04:43,596 --> 00:04:47,116
"Don't worry, Buddha," said Wukong.

65
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:50,826
"We will protect the scriptures with our lives."

66
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:55,685
A guard offered to carry the travelers to the Tang Empire.

67
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:58,079
"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

68
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:07,471
"What a relief!" said Bajie.

69
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:13,760
The guard recited a spell and then flew out of [n@the monastery with the travelers.

70
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:15,986
[g@Buddha turned to Guanyin.

71
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:20,143
"The Tang Monk and his companions have done well."@g]

72
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:21,723
[g@Guanyin nodded.

73
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:25,520
"Wukong especially has learned a lot during the journey.@g]

74
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:27,821
[g@He isn't violent anymore.

75
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:31,836
I believe he is now a good Buddhist."@g]

76
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:35,855
Just then a messenger ran into the hall.

77
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:45,332
"Bodhisattva!" he cried. "We have a problem!"
