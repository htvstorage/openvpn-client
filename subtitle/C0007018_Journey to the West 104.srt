1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:17,972
Wukong and his companions walked through the Western Paradise.

2
00:00:17,973 --> 00:00:23,385
The road weaved through a field of flowers and toward the Spirit Mountain.

3
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:28,148
Bajie looked up at the huge mountain and shook his head.

4
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:31,306
"It won't be easy to climb that."

5
00:00:31,307 --> 00:00:33,779
[g@Wukong laughed.

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,138
"Don't ask me to carry you!"@g]

7
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:42,064
The travelers soon arrived at a river with a strong current.

8
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:47,973
Waves crashed into jagged rocks, spraying water everywhere.

9
00:00:47,974 --> 00:00:51,526
"This river looks dangerous," said Wujing.

10
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:55,751
"But we must cross it to get to the Spirit Mountain."

11
00:00:55,752 --> 00:00:58,490
[g@Bajie sighed.

12
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:02,122
"We will never be able to cross [n@this river safely.

13
00:01:02,123 --> 00:01:04,437
Let's just go home."@g]

14
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,515
[g@"Nonsense," said Wukong.

15
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:10,309
"Look over there."@g]

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,034
[g@The monkey pointed upstream.

17
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:16,589
A thin log lay across the river.@g]

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,000
It wobbled and shook as the water rushed under it.

19
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,749
[g@The Tang Monk looked at the log.

20
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,533
"Don't be silly, Wukong.@g]

21
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:29,386
[g@We can't walk across that log—it's too thin.

22
00:01:29,387 --> 00:01:32,024
And it looks quite slippery."@g]

23
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:37,590
"But that log is the only way to reach the Spirit Mountain," said Wukong.

24
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:41,846
"You must believe that it's safe. Watch me!"

25
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:54,184
The monkey hopped onto the log and ran across the river and back.

26
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:58,431
"See?" he said. "It's safe."

27
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:00,802
[g@Bajie snorted.

28
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:03,243
"You don't weigh much, Wukong.

29
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:06,843
[n@But if I step on that log, it will break."@g]

30
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:09,742
[g@"I believe Wukong," said Wujing.

31
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:13,908
"We must walk across the log."@g]

32
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:17,098
[g@"Follow me, Master," said Wukong.

33
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,594
He pulled the Tang Monk toward the log.@g]

34
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:23,166
The monk trembled with fear.

35
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:25,241
[g@"Don't make me walk across that!

36
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:28,177
I'll fall into the river and drown!"@g]

37
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:32,234
"Let's just fly over the river," suggested Bajie.

38
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,960
"We can carry Master and the horse."

39
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:38,458
"No," insisted Wukong.

40
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,589
"The Tang Monk must make the entire journey by himself.

41
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,973
We're here to protect him, not to carry him.

42
00:02:45,974 --> 00:02:52,299
Buddha won't allow Master to have the True Scriptures [n@if he doesn't take every step himself."

43
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,470
Just then an old man appeared in a boat.

44
00:02:57,471 --> 00:03:01,225
"I can take you across the river," said the man.

45
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:05,718
[g@"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

46
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,529
He walked to the riverbank.@g]

47
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,051
[g@"My companion wanted me to walk across that log, but—"

48
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:14,781
The monk gasped.@g]

49
00:03:14,782 --> 00:03:18,630
"There's something wrong with your boat," he said to the man.

50
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,853
[g@"It has no bottom!

51
00:03:20,854 --> 00:03:23,729
Water is flowing right through it!"@g]

52
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,589
"The boat is safe," said the man.

53
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,088
[g@"Please climb in.

54
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:30,131
Buddha is waiting."@g]

55
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:40,769
With a bit more hesitation, the Tang Monk stepped into the boat.

56
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,744
He was shocked to find that he didn't sink.

57
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:50,413
He sat on the edge of the boat as Wujing led the horse aboard.

58
00:03:50,414 --> 00:03:57,378
Bajie and Wukong followed.

59
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:02,458
[g@The boat glided swiftly across the river.

60
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,023
Suddenly there was a splash.@g]

61
00:04:07,024 --> 00:04:12,973
The Tang Monk looked at the water and saw a body floating downstream.

62
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:14,179
[g@He screamed.

63
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,250
"A man has drowned!"@g]

64
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:20,230
[g@Wukong put his hand on the monk's shoulder and smiled.

65
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:22,452
"It's you, Master."@g]

66
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:25,943
"What?" said the monk. "Me?"

67
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:30,234
"Wukong is right!" cried Bajie. "It [i@is@i] you!"

68
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:34,393
"Look again, Master," said Wujing, smiling.

69
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:38,139
The Tang Monk looked at the body more carefully.

70
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,710
It was wearing the same Buddhist robe that he was wearing.

71
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:46,172
[g@"It [i@is@i] me," said the monk quietly.

72
00:04:46,173 --> 00:04:48,388
"But how . . . ?"@g]

73
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:52,512
"You got rid of your mortal body, Master," said Wukong.

74
00:04:52,513 --> 00:04:54,878
"You're a spirit now."

75
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:03,696
"You're one of us!" Bajie beamed.

76
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:16,620
The boat soon reached the other riverbank, and the travelers stepped out.

77
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:24,374
As they walked up the slope of the Spirit Mountain, [n@the Tang Monk laughed in amazement.

78
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,777
"I feel so light!" he said.

79
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:30,188
"I feel like I could run right up this mountain!"

80
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:34,773
"Good," said Bajie. "Perhaps you could carry me?"

81
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:44,130
Everybody laughed as they continued up the mountain.
