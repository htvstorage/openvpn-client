00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 195:31:50,933.3329999446869
Wukong and his companions walked through the Western Paradise.

2
195:33:30,933.3329999446869 --> 345:53:30,933.3329999446869
The road weaved through a field of flowers and toward the Spirit Mountain.

3
345:55:10,933.3329999446869 --> 478:11:50,933.3329999446869
Bajie looked up at the huge mountain and shook his head.

4
478:13:30,933.3329999446869 --> 565:55:10,933.3329999446869
"It won't be easy to climb that."

5
565:56:50,933.3329999446869 --> 634:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong laughed.

6
634:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 727:55:10,933.3330001831055
"Don't ask me to carry you!"@g]

7
727:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 864:45:10,933.3330001831055
The travelers soon arrived at a river with a strong current.

8
864:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1028:53:30,933.3330001831055
Waves crashed into jagged rocks, spraying water everywhere.

9
1028:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1127:35:10,933.3330001831055
"This river looks dangerous," said Wujing.

10
1127:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1244:56:50,933.3330001831055
"But we must cross it to get to the Spirit Mountain."

11
1244:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1321:01:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie sighed.

12
1321:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1421:55:10,933.3330001831055
"We will never be able to cross [n@this river safely.

13
1421:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1486:13:30,933.3330001831055
Let's just go home."@g]

14
1486:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1599:30:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Nonsense," said Wukong.

15
1599:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1649:20:10,933.3330001831055
"Look over there."@g]

16
1649:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1725:01:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The monkey pointed upstream.

17
1725:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1823:46:50,933.3330001831055
A thin log lay across the river.@g]

18
1823:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1946:18:30,933.3330001831055
It wobbled and shook as the water rushed under it.

19
1946:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2022:40:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk looked at the log.

20
2022:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2072:13:30,933.3330001831055
"Don't be silly, Wukong.@g]

21
2072:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2179:15:10,933.3330001831055
[g@We can't walk across that log—it's too thin.

22
2179:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2252:31:50,933.3330001831055
And it looks quite slippery."@g]

23
2252:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2407:08:30,933.3330001831055
"But that log is the only way to reach the Spirit Mountain," said Wukong.

24
2407:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2525:21:50,933.3330001831055
"You must believe that it's safe. Watch me!"

25
2525:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2868:05:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey hopped onto the log and ran across the river and back.

26
2868:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2986:03:30,933.3330001831055
"See?" he said. "It's safe."

27
2986:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3051:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie snorted.

28
3051:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3119:43:30,933.3330001831055
"You don't weigh much, Wukong.

29
3119:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3219:43:30,933.3330001831055
[n@But if I step on that log, it will break."@g]

30
3219:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3300:15:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"I believe Wukong," said Wujing.

31
3300:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3415:58:30,933.3330001831055
"We must walk across the log."@g]

32
3416:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3504:35:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Follow me, Master," said Wukong.

33
3504:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3601:41:50,933.3330001831055
He pulled the Tang Monk toward the log.@g]

34
3601:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3673:08:30,933.3330001831055
The monk trembled with fear.

35
3673:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3730:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Don't make me walk across that!

36
3730:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3812:20:10,933.3330001831055
I'll fall into the river and drown!"@g]

37
3812:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3925:01:50,933.3330001831055
"Let's just fly over the river," suggested Bajie.

38
3925:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4028:31:50,933.3330001831055
"We can carry Master and the horse."

39
4028:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4097:55:10,933.3330001831055
"No," insisted Wukong.

40
4097:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4212:40:10,933.3330001831055
"The Tang Monk must make the entire journey by himself.

41
4212:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4306:40:10,933.3330001831055
We're here to protect him, not to carry him.

42
4306:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4482:23:30,933.3330001831055
Buddha won't allow Master to have the True Scriptures [n@if he doesn't take every step himself."

43
4482:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4626:01:50,933.3330001831055
Just then an old man appeared in a boat.

44
4626:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4730:20:10,933.3330001831055
"I can take you across the river," said the man.

45
4730:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4855:08:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Thank you," said the Tang Monk.

46
4855:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4933:13:30,933.3330001831055
He walked to the riverbank.@g]

47
4933:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5031:03:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"My companion wanted me to walk across that log, but—"

48
5031:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5106:53:30,933.3330001831055
The monk gasped.@g]

49
5106:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5213:48:30,933.3330001831055
"There's something wrong with your boat," he said to the man.

50
5213:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5275:33:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"It has no bottom!

51
5275:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5355:26:50,933.3330001831055
Water is flowing right through it!"@g]

52
5355:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5434:53:30,933.3330001831055
"The boat is safe," said the man.

53
5434:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5476:31:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Please climb in.

54
5476:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5533:16:50,933.3330001831055
Buddha is waiting."@g]

55
5533:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5828:46:50,933.3330001831055
With a bit more hesitation, the Tang Monk stepped into the boat.

56
5828:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5939:11:50,933.3330001831055
He was shocked to find that he didn't sink.

57
5939:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6096:40:10,933.3330001831055
He sat on the edge of the boat as Wujing led the horse aboard.

58
6096:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6290:08:30,933.3330001831055
Bajie and Wukong followed.

59
6290:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6431:15:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The boat glided swiftly across the river.

60
6431:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6558:03:30,933.3330001831055
Suddenly there was a splash.@g]

61
6558:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6723:20:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk looked at the water and saw a body floating downstream.

62
6723:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6756:50:10,933.3330001831055
[g@He screamed.

63
6756:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6814:21:50,933.3330001831055
"A man has drowned!"@g]

64
6814:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6924:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong put his hand on the monk's shoulder and smiled.

65
6924:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6986:38:30,933.3330001831055
"It's you, Master."@g]

66
6986:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7083:36:50,933.3330001831055
"What?" said the monk. "Me?"

67
7083:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7202:48:30,933.3330001831055
"Wukong is right!" cried Bajie. "It [i@is@i] you!"

68
7202:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7318:20:10,933.3330001831055
"Look again, Master," said Wujing, smiling.

69
7318:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7422:23:30,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk looked at the body more carefully.

70
7422:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7549:21:50,933.3330001831055
It was wearing the same Buddhist robe that he was wearing.

71
7549:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7645:31:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"It [i@is@i] me," said the monk quietly.

72
7645:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7707:05:10,933.3330001831055
"But how . . . ?"@g]

73
7707:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7821:38:30,933.3330001831055
"You got rid of your mortal body, Master," said Wukong.

74
7821:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7887:21:50,933.3330001831055
"You're a spirit now."

75
7887:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8132:18:30,933.3330001831055
"You're one of us!" Bajie beamed.

76
8132:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8491:18:30,933.3330001831055
The boat soon reached the other riverbank, and the travelers stepped out.

77
8491:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8706:41:50,933.3330001831055
As they walked up the slope of the Spirit Mountain, [n@the Tang Monk laughed in amazement.

78
8706:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8773:26:50,933.3330001831055
"I feel so light!" he said.

79
8773:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8868:11:50,933.3330001831055
"I feel like I could run right up this mountain!"

80
8868:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8995:33:30,933.3330001831055
"Good," said Bajie. "Perhaps you could carry me?"

81
8995:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 9255:28:30,933.3330001831055
Everybody laughed as they continued up the mountain.
