00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 172:35:10,933.3329999446869
Bajie and Wujing swung their weapons at the demon.

2
172:36:50,933.3329999446869 --> 236:36:50,933.3329999446869
[g@"Ha!" The demon laughed.

3
236:38:30,933.3329999446869 --> 328:00:10,933.3329999446869
"I'm much too powerful for you!"@g]

4
328:01:50,933.3329999446869 --> 426:30:10,933.3329999446869
From inside the cymbals, Wukong heard the fight.

5
426:31:50,933.3329999446869 --> 534:41:50,933.3329999446869
He heard grunts and the sounds of weapons clashing.

6
534:43:30,933.3329999446869 --> 621:01:50,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk cried, "No!"

7
621:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 693:03:30,933.3330001831055
Then there was silence.

8
693:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 786:38:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"What happened out there?" shouted Wukong.

9
786:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 864:03:30,933.3330001831055
There was no answer.@g]

10
864:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1043:35:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey punched and kicked the inside of the cymbals for hours.

11
1043:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1164:30:10,933.3330001831055
But the two cymbals would not come apart.

12
1164:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1257:05:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"This is terrible," he said to himself.

13
1257:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1328:30:10,933.3330001831055
"How will I get out of here?"@g]

14
1328:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1454:00:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey was about to strike the cymbals again when he heard a voice.

15
1454:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1547:01:50,933.3330001831055
"Wukong, are you in there?"

16
1547:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1626:23:30,933.3330001831055
"Who is that?" Wukong asked.

17
1626:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1710:40:10,933.3330001831055
"I'm the Gold Dragon," said the voice.

18
1710:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1785:00:10,933.3330001831055
"The Jade Emperor sent me to help you.

19
1785:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1981:56:50,933.3330001831055
I'll wedge my horn between the cymbals and pry them apart."

20
1981:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2065:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Please hurry!" said Wukong.

21
2065:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2167:20:10,933.3330001831055
Slowly the dragon's horn poked through.

22
2167:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2280:26:50,933.3330001831055
But the cymbals were still tightly clasped together.

23
2280:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2393:46:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong groaned. "I can't escape."

24
2393:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2517:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Maybe we can find another way to pry the cymbals apart," said the dragon.

25
2517:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2625:15:10,933.3330001831055
"Actually, I have a different idea," said the monkey.

26
2625:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2771:00:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong turned his iron bar into a drill.

27
2771:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2932:35:10,933.3330001831055
He made a hole in the dragon's horn.

28
2932:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3078:55:10,933.3330001831055
Then he made himself tiny and climbed into the hole.

29
3078:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3209:18:30,933.3330001831055
"Pull your horn out now!" said Wukong.

30
3209:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3374:13:30,933.3330001831055
The dragon pulled and pulled and finally got his horn out.

31
3374:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3527:55:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey jumped out of the hole and returned to his normal size.

32
3527:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3591:35:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Thank you," said Wukong.

33
3591:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3655:26:50,933.3330001831055
"Now we must free my friends."@g]

34
3655:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3732:05:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"We have to be quiet," said the dragon.

35
3732:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3797:18:30,933.3330001831055
"The demon is sleeping."@g]

36
3797:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3839:38:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong nodded.

37
3839:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3956:05:10,933.3330001831055
Then he turned toward the cymbals and raised his iron bar.@g]

38
3956:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4069:55:10,933.3330001831055
[i@Smash!@i] The cymbals shattered.

39
4069:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4160:58:30,933.3330001831055
"Why did you do that?" cried the dragon.

40
4161:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4235:40:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong shrugged. "I was angry."

41
4235:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4310:05:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The demon stormed into the room.

42
4310:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4420:05:10,933.3330001831055
"Sun Wukong! How did you escape?"@g]

43
4420:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4497:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Who are you?" demanded Wukong.

44
4497:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4566:48:30,933.3330001831055
"How do you know my name?"@g]

45
4566:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4677:01:50,933.3330001831055
"My name is Yellow Brows," said the demon.

46
4677:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4804:26:50,933.3330001831055
"I've been waiting for you and the Tang Monk to pass by my mountain."

47
4804:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4897:10:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong narrowed his eyes. "Why?"

48
4897:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4977:30:10,933.3330001831055
"I'm a Buddhist," said the demon.

49
4977:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5137:06:50,933.3330001831055
"I plan to go to the Western Paradise and get the True Scriptures myself."

50
5137:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5217:48:30,933.3330001831055
"You can't do that!" shouted Wukong.

51
5217:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5315:30:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey and the dragon charged toward the demon.

52
5315:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5473:46:50,933.3330001831055
The demon pulled a cloth from his robe and threw it.

53
5473:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5704:00:10,933.3330001831055
The cloth wrapped around Wukong and the dragon, [n@and then became very small.

54
5704:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5769:13:30,933.3330001831055
Soon they were tied up in a room.

55
5769:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5894:41:50,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk, Bajie, and Wujing were also in the room.

56
5894:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5967:26:50,933.3330001831055
Their bags were lying in a corner.

57
5967:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6066:45:10,933.3330001831055
"I'm sorry for not believing you, Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

58
6066:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6151:23:30,933.3330001831055
"You suspected this place was dangerous."

59
6151:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6233:10:10,933.3330001831055
"Don't worry about that, Master," said the monkey.

60
6233:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6319:50:10,933.3330001831055
"We must escape as soon as the demon goes back to sleep.

61
6319:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6448:21:50,933.3330001831055
He plans to get the True Scriptures himself."

62
6448:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6531:46:50,933.3330001831055
The group waited for a while.

63
6531:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6671:15:10,933.3330001831055
Finally Wukong made himself tiny and slipped out from his ropes.

64
6671:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6777:43:30,933.3330001831055
He untied his companions and the dragon.

65
6777:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6843:35:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Let's go," the monkey whispered.

66
6843:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6907:06:50,933.3330001831055
"Bajie, get the bags."@g]

67
6907:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7047:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Everyone, be quiet," the dragon warned.

68
7047:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7170:33:30,933.3330001831055
They tiptoed through the monastery and were soon outside.

69
7170:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7258:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong looked at Bajie and frowned.

70
7258:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7316:25:10,933.3330001831055
"Where are the bags?"@g]

71
7316:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7381:08:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The pig moaned.

72
7381:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7442:48:30,933.3330001831055
"I forgot them."@g]

73
7442:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7612:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Master's special robe is in one of those bags!" Wukong sighed.

74
7612:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7746:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Wait here. I'll go back in and get them."

75
7746:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7861:25:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey quietly hurried back to the room and grabbed the bags.

76
7861:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8019:36:50,933.3330001831055
But as he was leaving, he tripped and knocked over a statue. [i@Bang!@i]

77
8019:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8140:06:50,933.3330001831055
From another room Yellow Brows shouted, "What was that?"

78
8140:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8320:00:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong gulped. "Uh-oh."
