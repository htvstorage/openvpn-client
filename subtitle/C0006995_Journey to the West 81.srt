1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:17,146
Bajie and Wujing swung their weapons at the demon.

2
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:19,451
[g@"Ha!" The demon laughed.

3
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:22,741
"I'm much too powerful for you!"@g]

4
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:26,287
From inside the cymbals, Wukong heard the fight.

5
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:30,182
He heard grunts and the sounds of weapons clashing.

6
00:00:30,183 --> 00:00:33,290
The Tang Monk cried, "No!"

7
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,883
Then there was silence.

8
00:00:35,884 --> 00:00:39,252
[g@"What happened out there?" shouted Wukong.

9
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:42,039
There was no answer.@g]

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,502
The monkey punched and kicked the inside of the cymbals for hours.

11
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:52,855
But the two cymbals would not come apart.

12
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:56,188
[g@"This is terrible," he said to himself.

13
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,759
"How will I get out of here?"@g]

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,277
The monkey was about to strike the cymbals again when he heard a voice.

15
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:06,626
"Wukong, are you in there?"

16
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:09,483
"Who is that?" Wukong asked.

17
00:01:09,484 --> 00:01:12,517
"I'm the Gold Dragon," said the voice.

18
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:15,193
"The Jade Emperor sent me to help you.

19
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:22,283
I'll wedge my horn between the cymbals and pry them apart."

20
00:01:22,284 --> 00:01:25,283
"Please hurry!" said Wukong.

21
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:28,957
Slowly the dragon's horn poked through.

22
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:33,029
But the cymbals were still tightly clasped together.

23
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,109
Wukong groaned. "I can't escape."

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,573
"Maybe we can find another way to pry the cymbals apart," said the dragon.

25
00:01:41,574 --> 00:01:45,442
"Actually, I have a different idea," said the monkey.

26
00:01:45,443 --> 00:01:50,689
Wukong turned his iron bar into a drill.

27
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:56,506
He made a hole in the dragon's horn.

28
00:01:56,507 --> 00:02:01,774
Then he made himself tiny and climbed into the hole.

29
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:06,468
"Pull your horn out now!" said Wukong.

30
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:12,405
The dragon pulled and pulled and finally got his horn out.

31
00:02:12,406 --> 00:02:17,938
The monkey jumped out of the hole and returned to his normal size.

32
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:20,230
[g@"Thank you," said Wukong.

33
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:22,529
"Now we must free my friends."@g]

34
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,288
[g@"We have to be quiet," said the dragon.

35
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,636
"The demon is sleeping."@g]

36
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:29,160
[g@Wukong nodded.

37
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:33,352
Then he turned toward the cymbals and raised his iron bar.@g]

38
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,450
[i@Smash!@i] The cymbals shattered.

39
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:40,728
"Why did you do that?" cried the dragon.

40
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,417
Wukong shrugged. "I was angry."

41
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:46,096
[g@The demon stormed into the room.

42
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:50,056
"Sun Wukong! How did you escape?"@g]

43
00:02:50,057 --> 00:02:52,837
[g@"Who are you?" demanded Wukong.

44
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:55,338
"How do you know my name?"@g]

45
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:59,306
"My name is Yellow Brows," said the demon.

46
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:03,893
"I've been waiting for you and the Tang Monk to pass by my mountain."

47
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:07,231
Wukong narrowed his eyes. "Why?"

48
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:10,123
"I'm a Buddhist," said the demon.

49
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:15,869
"I plan to go to the Western Paradise and get the True Scriptures myself."

50
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,774
"You can't do that!" shouted Wukong.

51
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:22,291
The monkey and the dragon charged toward the demon.

52
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:27,989
The demon pulled a cloth from his robe and threw it.

53
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:36,277
The cloth wrapped around Wukong and the dragon, [n@and then became very small.

54
00:03:36,278 --> 00:03:38,625
Soon they were tied up in a room.

55
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:43,142
The Tang Monk, Bajie, and Wujing were also in the room.

56
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:45,761
Their bags were lying in a corner.

57
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:49,336
"I'm sorry for not believing you, Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

58
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:52,383
"You suspected this place was dangerous."

59
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:55,327
"Don't worry about that, Master," said the monkey.

60
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:58,447
"We must escape as soon as the demon goes back to sleep.

61
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:03,074
He plans to get the True Scriptures himself."

62
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:06,077
The group waited for a while.

63
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:11,098
Finally Wukong made himself tiny and slipped out from his ropes.

64
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,931
He untied his companions and the dragon.

65
00:04:14,932 --> 00:04:17,302
[g@"Let's go," the monkey whispered.

66
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:19,589
"Bajie, get the bags."@g]

67
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,635
"Everyone, be quiet," the dragon warned.

68
00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:29,073
They tiptoed through the monastery and were soon outside.

69
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:32,225
[g@Wukong looked at Bajie and frowned.

70
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:34,324
"Where are the bags?"@g]

71
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:36,654
[g@The pig moaned.

72
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:38,874
"I forgot them."@g]

73
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:44,997
"Master's special robe is in one of those bags!" Wukong sighed.

74
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:49,807
"Wait here. I'll go back in and get them."

75
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:53,944
The monkey quietly hurried back to the room and grabbed the bags.

76
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:59,639
But as he was leaving, he tripped and knocked over a statue. [i@Bang!@i]

77
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,977
From another room Yellow Brows shouted, "What was that?"

78
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:10,453
Wukong gulped. "Uh-oh."
