1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,158
Wukong stared at the mountains.

2
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:19,342
"A red cloud keeps appearing over those mountains," he said.

3
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:22,702
"There must be a demon ahead."

4
00:00:22,703 --> 00:00:27,746
"The road leads right into those mountains," said the Tang Monk nervously.

5
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:31,794
Wukong nodded. "We must be careful."

6
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:35,394
He pulled out his iron bar and held it up.

7
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:41,245
Wujing held up his spear, and Bajie held up his rake.

8
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:44,562
The group walked cautiously.

9
00:00:44,563 --> 00:00:50,615
A red demon sat on a mountain peak, watching the travelers approach.

10
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:56,578
"The Tang Monk has finally arrived at my mountain," the demon said to himself.

11
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,403
"I've heard that eating just one bite of him will make me live forever."

12
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:05,372
The demon looked at the travelers again.

13
00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:11,771
"Uh-oh. The monk's companions have their weapons out.

14
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,621
They probably saw my red cloud.

15
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:17,757
I'll have to trick them with a disguise."

16
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:22,986
The demon made himself look like a scared little boy.

17
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:29,560
Then he went down to the road, sat alongside it, and waited.

18
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:32,090
Soon the travelers approached.

19
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:38,791
The Tang Monk saw the boy and got down from his horse.

20
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:41,833
"Master, that's a demon," warned Wukong.

21
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:44,926
The Tang Monk scowled at the monkey.

22
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:47,717
"He's just a scared little boy."

23
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:51,411
He turned back to the boy. "What's wrong?"

24
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:55,680
"My family was attacked by robbers," said the boy.

25
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,160
"Please help me."

26
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:01,123
"I know what you are!" shouted Wukong.

27
00:02:01,124 --> 00:02:04,691
"You're a demon! I won't let you eat the Tang Monk!"

28
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:07,329
The boy looked horrified.

29
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,961
"Wukong!" snapped the Tang Monk.

30
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:13,377
"You're scaring him!"

31
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:17,953
"Master, you're being a fool again!" cried the monkey.

32
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:22,745
"You always fall for demons' tricks, and you never believe me."

33
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:25,718
"Be quiet, Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

34
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:29,289
"Or I'll recite the Tight Headband spell."

35
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,308
Wukong glared angrily at the boy.

36
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:35,829
But he didn't say another word.

37
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,090
The Tang Monk helped the boy to stand up.

38
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:41,598
"Can you walk?" asked the monk.

39
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,388
The boy shook his head.

40
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:45,788
"My leg is injured."

41
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:48,689
The Tang Monk waved Wukong over.

42
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,441
"Please carry the boy.

43
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:55,895
And don't be mean to him."

44
00:02:55,896 --> 00:03:02,097
The group continued west, with Wukong carrying the boy on his back.

45
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:07,871
The monkey walked slowly, and soon his companions were far ahead.

46
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:11,912
"You tricked the Tang Monk," said Wukong to the boy.

47
00:03:11,913 --> 00:03:14,340
"But you haven't tricked me.

48
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:17,784
I know you're a demon."

49
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:25,142
"I don't know what you're talking about," said the boy.

50
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:31,113
A powerful wind blew, uprooting trees and almost knocking over Wukong.

51
00:03:31,114 --> 00:03:33,230
The monkey laughed.

52
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:36,329
"I know that you're making this wind blow.

53
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,446
Use all the magic you want.

54
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,985
You won't be able to blow me away.

55
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:47,656
I once defeated Heaven's entire army!"

56
00:03:47,657 --> 00:03:52,616
The road now ran along the edge of a cliff.

57
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:54,314
Wukong looked down.

58
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:58,615
"I'll throw you over the edge of this cliff," he said.

59
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:01,726
"Then I'll just tell the Tang Monk you ran away."

60
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:04,455
The monkey tried to grab the boy from his back.

61
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:07,775
But at that moment, the boy disappeared.

62
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:12,459
Wukong laughed. "He must have gotten scared."

63
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,141
The wind suddenly grew stronger, and dust filled the air.

64
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:22,797
Wukong heard screams and rushed ahead to find his friends.

65
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:27,221
"Master!" cried the monkey, trying to see through the dust.

66
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:29,599
"Where are you?"

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,977
When the wind stopped, he saw Bajie and Wujing lying by the road.

68
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:40,231
"That was some wind," said the pig, getting up.

69
00:04:40,232 --> 00:04:43,189
"It knocked us over," said Wujing.

70
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,684
Wukong looked frantically around. "Where's Master?"

71
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:50,436
"Oh no!" cried Bajie.

72
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:52,582
"That boy was a demon.

73
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,424
He kidnapped Master!"

74
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:57,536
Wukong shook his head.

75
00:04:57,537 --> 00:05:00,124
"Let's all go home.

76
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:05,447
The journey is over."
