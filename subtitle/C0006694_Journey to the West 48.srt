1
00:00:11,000 --> 115:30:11,000
Wukong stared at the mountains.

2
115:31:51,000 --> 231:43:31,000
"A red cloud keeps appearing over those mountains," he said.

3
231:45:11,000 --> 325:03:31,000
"There must be a demon ahead."

4
325:05:11,000 --> 465:10:11,000
"The road leads right into those mountains," said the Tang Monk nervously.

5
465:11:51,000 --> 577:36:51,000
Wukong nodded. "We must be careful."

6
577:38:31,000 --> 677:36:51,000
He pulled out his iron bar and held it up.

7
677:38:31,000 --> 840:08:31,000
Wujing held up his spear, and Bajie held up his rake.

8
840:10:11,000 --> 932:16:51,000
The group walked cautiously.

9
932:18:31,000 --> 1100:25:11,000
A red demon sat on a mountain peak, watching the travelers approach.

10
1100:26:51,000 --> 1266:03:31,000
"The Tang Monk has finally arrived at my mountain," [n@the demon said to himself.

11
1266:05:11,000 --> 1427:51:51,000
"I've heard that eating just one bite of him will make me live forever."

12
1427:53:31,000 --> 1510:20:11,000
The demon looked at the travelers again.

13
1510:21:51,000 --> 1688:05:11,000
"Uh-oh. The monk's companions have their weapons out.

14
1688:06:51,000 --> 1767:15:11,000
[g@They probably saw my red cloud.

15
1767:16:51,000 --> 1854:21:51,000
I'll have to trick them with a disguise."@g]

16
1854:23:31,000 --> 1999:36:51,000
The demon made himself look like a scared little boy.

17
1999:38:31,000 --> 2182:13:31,000
Then he went down to the road, sat alongside it, and waited.

18
2182:15:11,000 --> 2252:30:11,000
Soon the travelers approached.

19
2252:31:51,000 --> 2438:38:31,000
The Tang Monk saw the boy and got down from his horse.

20
2438:40:11,000 --> 2523:08:31,000
"Master, that's a demon," warned Wukong.

21
2523:10:11,000 --> 2609:03:31,000
[g@The Tang Monk scowled at the monkey.

22
2609:05:11,000 --> 2686:35:11,000
"He's just a scared little boy."@g]

23
2686:36:51,000 --> 2789:11:51,000
He turned back to the boy. "What's wrong?"

24
2789:13:31,000 --> 2907:46:51,000
[g@"My family was attacked by robbers," said the boy.

25
2907:48:31,000 --> 2976:40:11,000
"Please help me."@g]

26
2976:41:51,000 --> 3058:58:31,000
"I know what you are!" shouted Wukong.

27
3059:00:11,000 --> 3158:05:11,000
"You're a demon! I won't let you eat the Tang Monk!"

28
3158:06:51,000 --> 3231:21:51,000
The boy looked horrified.

29
3231:23:31,000 --> 3304:28:31,000
[g@"Wukong!" snapped the Tang Monk.

30
3304:30:11,000 --> 3399:21:51,000
"You're scaring him!"@g]

31
3399:23:31,000 --> 3526:28:31,000
"Master, you're being a fool again!" cried the monkey.

32
3526:30:11,000 --> 3659:35:11,000
"You always fall for demons' tricks, and you never believe me."

33
3659:36:51,000 --> 3742:10:11,000
"Be quiet, Wukong," said the Tang Monk.

34
3742:11:51,000 --> 3841:21:51,000
"Or I'll recite the Tight Headband spell."

35
3841:23:31,000 --> 3925:13:31,000
[g@Wukong glared angrily at the boy.

36
3925:15:11,000 --> 4023:01:51,000
But he didn't say another word.@g]

37
4023:03:31,000 --> 4113:36:51,000
[g@The Tang Monk helped the boy to stand up.

38
4113:38:31,000 --> 4183:16:51,000
"Can you walk?" asked the monk.@g]

39
4183:18:31,000 --> 4233:00:11,000
[g@The boy shook his head.

40
4233:01:51,000 --> 4299:40:11,000
"My leg is injured."@g]

41
4299:41:51,000 --> 4380:15:11,000
The Tang Monk waved Wukong over.

42
4380:16:51,000 --> 4428:55:11,000
[g@"Please carry the boy.

43
4428:56:51,000 --> 4580:25:11,000
And don't be mean to him."@g]

44
4580:26:51,000 --> 4752:41:51,000
The group continued west, with Wukong carrying the boy on his back.

45
4752:43:31,000 --> 4913:05:11,000
The monkey walked slowly, and soon his companions were far ahead.

46
4913:06:51,000 --> 5025:20:11,000
"You tricked the Tang Monk," said Wukong to the boy.

47
5025:21:51,000 --> 5092:46:51,000
[g@"But you haven't tricked me.

48
5092:48:31,000 --> 5188:26:51,000
I know you're a demon."@g]

49
5188:28:31,000 --> 5392:50:11,000
"I don't know what you're talking about," said the boy.

50
5392:51:51,000 --> 5558:41:51,000
A powerful wind blew, uprooting trees and almost knocking over Wukong.

51
5558:43:31,000 --> 5617:30:11,000
[g@The monkey laughed.

52
5617:31:51,000 --> 5703:35:11,000
"I know that you're making this wind blow.@g]

53
5703:36:51,000 --> 5762:23:31,000
[g@Use all the magic you want.

54
5762:25:11,000 --> 5832:55:11,000
You won't be able to blow me away.@g]

55
5832:56:51,000 --> 6018:13:31,000
I once defeated Heaven's entire army!"

56
6018:15:11,000 --> 6156:00:11,000
[g@The road now ran along the edge of a cliff.

57
6156:01:51,000 --> 6203:10:11,000
Wukong looked down.@g]

58
6203:11:51,000 --> 6322:38:31,000
"I'll throw you over the edge of this cliff," he said.

59
6322:40:11,000 --> 6409:03:31,000
"Then I'll just tell the Tang Monk you ran away."

60
6409:05:11,000 --> 6484:51:51,000
The monkey tried to grab the boy from his back.

61
6484:53:31,000 --> 6577:05:11,000
But at that moment, the boy disappeared.

62
6577:06:51,000 --> 6707:11:51,000
Wukong laughed. "He must have gotten scared."

63
6707:13:31,000 --> 6865:01:51,000
The wind suddenly grew stronger, and dust filled the air.

64
6865:03:31,000 --> 6994:21:51,000
Wukong heard screams and rushed ahead to find his friends.

65
6994:23:31,000 --> 7117:15:11,000
"Master!" cried the monkey, trying to see through the dust.

66
7117:16:51,000 --> 7183:18:31,000
"Where are you?"

67
7183:20:11,000 --> 7388:15:11,000
When the wind stopped, he saw Bajie and Wujing lying by the road.

68
7388:16:51,000 --> 7478:38:31,000
"That was some wind," said the pig, getting up.

69
7478:40:11,000 --> 7560:48:31,000
"It knocked us over," said Wujing.

70
7560:50:11,000 --> 7685:40:11,000
Wukong looked frantically around. "Where's Master?"

71
7685:41:51,000 --> 7762:06:51,000
[g@"Oh no!" cried Bajie.

72
7762:08:31,000 --> 7821:43:31,000
"That boy [i@was@i] a demon.

73
7821:45:11,000 --> 7900:40:11,000
He kidnapped Master!"@g]

74
7900:41:51,000 --> 7959:20:11,000
Wukong shook his head.

75
7959:21:51,000 --> 8031:13:31,000
[g@"Let's all go home.

76
8031:15:11,000 --> 8179:05:11,000
The journey is over."@g]
