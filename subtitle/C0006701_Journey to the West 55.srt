1
00:00:11,000 --> 284:28:31,000
"Everybody, wake up!" called Wukong.

2
284:30:11,000 --> 392:36:51,000
The travelers had camped for a night in the woods.

3
392:38:31,000 --> 500:31:51,000
[g@The Tang Monk woke up and stretched.

4
500:33:31,000 --> 582:43:31,000
Wujing opened his eyes and yawned.@g]

5
582:45:11,000 --> 673:11:51,000
[g@Bajie moaned, "It's too early.

6
673:13:31,000 --> 810:20:11,000
Let me sleep just a few more hours."@g]

7
810:21:51,000 --> 899:40:11,000
"Bajie, don't be lazy," said the Tang Monk.

8
899:41:51,000 --> 944:15:11,000
[g@"It's time to get up.

9
944:16:51,000 --> 1041:31:51,000
Please start making breakfast."@g]

10
1041:33:31,000 --> 1111:41:51,000
[g@The pig got to his feet.

11
1111:43:31,000 --> 1194:15:11,000
"All we do is work," he said.@g]

12
1194:16:51,000 --> 1375:06:51,000
"Cook food . . . carry bags . . . walk, walk, walk!"

13
1375:08:31,000 --> 1463:01:51,000
"We're on a noble mission," said Wujing.

14
1463:03:31,000 --> 1600:40:11,000
"Because of our difficult journey, the Tang Empire [n@will have the True Scriptures.

15
1600:41:51,000 --> 1746:25:11,000
You should be happy to do all this work."

16
1746:26:51,000 --> 1867:16:51,000
After a quick breakfast, the group started walking.

17
1867:18:31,000 --> 2162:40:11,000
They went through a valley and over some hills.

18
2162:41:51,000 --> 2246:21:51,000
Later that afternoon they heard yelling.

19
2246:23:31,000 --> 2341:15:11,000
"It sounds like some people are in trouble," said the Tang Monk.

20
2341:16:51,000 --> 2465:33:31,000
Wujing nodded. "Yes. I wonder what's going on."

21
2465:35:11,000 --> 2536:58:31,000
[g@"You all wait here," said Wukong.

22
2537:00:11,000 --> 2607:46:51,000
"I'll go and investigate."@g]

23
2607:48:31,000 --> 2752:33:31,000
The monkey leaped into the air and looked around.

24
2752:35:11,000 --> 2883:25:11,000
He saw a group of Buddhist monks pushing a cart up a steep hill.

25
2883:26:51,000 --> 2976:28:31,000
[g@The cart was loaded with big stones.

26
2976:30:11,000 --> 3052:21:51,000
The monks looked miserable.@g]

27
3052:23:31,000 --> 3128:16:51,000
Their robes were dirty and ripped.

28
3128:18:31,000 --> 3207:53:31,000
[g@Two Daoist priests stood nearby.

29
3207:55:11,000 --> 3298:50:11,000
They were dressed in fine clothes.@g]

30
3298:51:51,000 --> 3390:16:51,000
"Work faster!" yelled one of the priests.

31
3390:18:31,000 --> 3461:51:51,000
[g@The Buddhists looked frightened.

32
3461:53:31,000 --> 3563:36:51,000
They struggled to move the cart faster.@g]

33
3563:38:31,000 --> 3664:31:51,000
"Why are those monks pushing that cart?" thought Wukong.

34
3664:33:31,000 --> 3869:38:31,000
"And why are they scared of the Daoists?"

35
3869:40:11,000 --> 3969:31:51,000
The monkey waited for the Daoists to leave.

36
3969:33:31,000 --> 4146:16:51,000
Then he made himself look like a Buddhist monk.

37
4146:18:31,000 --> 4270:08:31,000
"Hello," said Wukong, walking toward the group of monks.

38
4270:10:11,000 --> 4338:25:11,000
"Why are you pushing this cart?"

39
4338:26:51,000 --> 4450:23:31,000
The monks stopped pushing the cart and turned toward Wukong.

40
4450:25:11,000 --> 4515:13:31,000
They looked surprised.

41
4515:15:11,000 --> 4612:36:51,000
"You must be new here," one monk said.

42
4612:38:31,000 --> 4696:06:51,000
"You should leave before you're discovered."

43
4696:08:31,000 --> 4767:18:31,000
"Why?" asked Wukong.

44
4767:20:11,000 --> 4872:46:51,000
"Daoists are in charge here," said another monk.

45
4872:48:31,000 --> 5033:48:31,000
Wukong shrugged. "People from different religions can still get along."

46
5033:50:11,000 --> 5115:13:31,000
"Not in this kingdom," said the first monk.

47
5115:15:11,000 --> 5191:08:31,000
[g@"Buddhists are treated horribly here.

48
5191:10:11,000 --> 5271:33:31,000
The Daoists make us do hard work."@g]

49
5271:35:11,000 --> 5389:11:51,000
"Why do the Daoists treat you so badly?" asked Wukong.

50
5389:13:31,000 --> 5500:06:51,000
"Years ago this kingdom had a drought," said the monk.

51
5500:08:31,000 --> 5582:13:31,000
"Crops died and people starved.

52
5582:15:11,000 --> 5657:38:31,000
[g@Buddhist monks prayed to Buddha for rain.

53
5657:40:11,000 --> 5749:00:11,000
But no rain came."@g]

54
5749:01:51,000 --> 5869:31:51,000
"One day a powerful Daoist arrived," said the other monk.

55
5869:33:31,000 --> 5937:26:51,000
"He's called the Tiger Immortal.

56
5937:28:31,000 --> 6060:30:11,000
He recited prayers, and right away rain fell.

57
6060:31:51,000 --> 6142:56:51,000
Since then Daoists have been in charge.

58
6142:58:31,000 --> 6321:10:11,000
They destroyed all the Buddhist monasteries and statues."

59
6321:11:51,000 --> 6399:06:51,000
[g@"That's terrible," said Wukong.

60
6399:08:31,000 --> 6487:15:11,000
"Those Daoists can't get away with this."@g]

61
6487:16:51,000 --> 6589:25:11,000
"The Daoists won't treat us this way forever," said a third monk.

62
6589:26:51,000 --> 6696:33:31,000
"The spirit of the planet Venus visited us in a dream one night.

63
6696:35:11,000 --> 6808:06:51,000
He said that one day someone would come along to save us."

64
6808:08:31,000 --> 6921:40:11,000
[g@"Oh really?" Wukong raised an eyebrow.

65
6921:41:51,000 --> 6990:08:31,000
"Who is going to save you?"@g]

66
6990:10:11,000 --> 7069:56:51,000
[g@"A fierce monkey spirit," said the monk.

67
7069:58:31,000 --> 7132:55:11,000
"His name is Sun Wukong.@g]

68
7132:56:51,000 --> 7279:01:51,000
He is so powerful that Heaven's entire army couldn't defeat him!"

69
7279:03:31,000 --> 7412:50:11,000
Wukong smiled. "I've heard of Sun Wukong.

70
7412:51:51,000 --> 7486:48:31,000
And it's true that he's very powerful.

71
7486:50:11,000 --> 7558:58:31,000
Did Venus tell you what he looks like?"

72
7559:00:11,000 --> 7627:56:51,000
"Oh yes," said the monk.

73
7627:58:31,000 --> 7698:03:31,000
[g@"So you'll recognize him if you see him?"

74
7698:05:11,000 --> 7780:13:31,000
asked Wukong, trying not to laugh.@g]

75
7780:15:11,000 --> 7844:10:11,000
[g@"Certainly," said the monk.

76
7844:11:51,000 --> 7925:21:51,000
"Why do you ask?"@g]

77
7925:23:31,000 --> 7988:56:51,000
[g@Light sparkled around Wukong.

78
7988:58:31,000 --> 8077:03:31,000
A moment later he was a monkey again.@g]

79
8077:05:11,000 --> 8184:21:51,000
[g@"Sun Wukong!" cried the monks.

80
8184:23:31,000 --> 8364:33:31,000
They all fell to their knees and bowed.@g]
