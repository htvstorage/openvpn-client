1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,241
"Everybody, wake up!" called Wukong.

2
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:25,134
The travelers had camped for a night in the woods.

3
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:29,019
The Tang Monk woke up and stretched.

4
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,978
Wujing opened his eyes and yawned.

5
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:35,235
Bajie moaned, "It's too early.

6
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:40,172
Let me sleep just a few more hours."

7
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,388
"Bajie, don't be lazy," said the Tang Monk.

8
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:44,993
"It's time to get up.

9
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:48,495
Please start making breakfast."

10
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:51,021
The pig got to his feet.

11
00:00:51,022 --> 00:00:53,993
"All we do is work," he said.

12
00:00:53,994 --> 00:01:00,504
"Cook food . . . carry bags . . . walk, walk, walk!"

13
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:03,669
"We're on a noble mission," said Wujing.

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,624
"Because of our difficult journey, the Tang Empire will have the True Scriptures.

15
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:13,871
You should be happy to do all this work."

16
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:18,222
After a quick breakfast, the group started walking.

17
00:01:18,223 --> 00:01:28,856
They went through a valley and over some hills.

18
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:31,869
Later that afternoon they heard yelling.

19
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,285
"It sounds like some people are in trouble," said the Tang Monk.

20
00:01:35,286 --> 00:01:39,760
Wujing nodded. "Yes. I wonder what's going on."

21
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:42,331
"You all wait here," said Wukong.

22
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:44,880
"I'll go and investigate."

23
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:50,092
The monkey leaped into the air and looked around.

24
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:54,803
He saw a group of Buddhist monks pushing a cart up a steep hill.

25
00:01:54,804 --> 00:01:58,153
The cart was loaded with big stones.

26
00:01:58,154 --> 00:02:00,885
The monks looked miserable.

27
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:03,618
Their robes were dirty and ripped.

28
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:06,484
Two Daoist priests stood nearby.

29
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:09,758
They were dressed in fine clothes.

30
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,050
"Work faster!" yelled one of the priests.

31
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:15,627
The Buddhists looked frightened.

32
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:19,290
They struggled to move the cart faster.

33
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,923
"Why are those monks pushing that cart?" thought Wukong.

34
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:30,307
"And why are they scared of the Daoists?"

35
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:33,903
The monkey waited for the Daoists to leave.

36
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:40,266
Then he made himself look like a Buddhist monk.

37
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:44,725
"Hello," said Wukong, walking toward the group of monks.

38
00:02:44,726 --> 00:02:47,183
"Why are you pushing this cart?"

39
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:51,214
The monks stopped pushing the cart and turned toward Wukong.

40
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:53,548
They looked surprised.

41
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,054
"You must be new here," one monk said.

42
00:02:57,055 --> 00:03:00,060
"You should leave before you're discovered."

43
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:02,623
"Why?" asked Wukong.

44
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:06,420
"Daoists are in charge here," said another monk.

45
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:12,217
Wukong shrugged. "People from different religions can still get along."

46
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:15,148
"Not in this kingdom," said the first monk.

47
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:17,881
"Buddhists are treated horribly here.

48
00:03:17,882 --> 00:03:20,776
The Daoists make us do hard work."

49
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:25,011
"Why do the Daoists treat you so badly?" asked Wukong.

50
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:29,004
"Years ago this kingdom had a drought," said the monk.

51
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:31,960
"Crops died and people starved.

52
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,675
Buddhist monks prayed to Buddha for rain.

53
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:37,964
But no rain came."

54
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:42,303
"One day a powerful Daoist arrived," said the other monk.

55
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:44,748
"He's called the Tiger Immortal.

56
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:49,178
He recited prayers, and right away rain fell.

57
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:52,146
Since then Daoists have been in charge.

58
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:58,562
They destroyed all the Buddhist monasteries and statues."

59
00:03:58,563 --> 00:04:01,368
"That's terrible," said Wukong.

60
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:04,541
"Those Daoists can't get away with this."

61
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:08,219
"The Daoists won't treat us this way forever," said a third monk.

62
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,076
"The spirit of the planet Venus visited us in a dream one night.

63
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:16,092
He said that one day someone would come along to save us."

64
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:20,180
"Oh really?" Wukong raised an eyebrow.

65
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:22,645
"Who is going to save you?"

66
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:25,518
"A fierce monkey spirit," said the monk.

67
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,785
"His name is Sun Wukong.

68
00:04:27,786 --> 00:04:33,045
He is so powerful that Heaven's entire army couldn't defeat him!"

69
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:37,862
Wukong smiled. "I've heard of Sun Wukong.

70
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:40,525
And it's true that he's very powerful.

71
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:43,123
Did Venus tell you what he looks like?"

72
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:45,606
"Oh yes," said the monk.

73
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:48,130
"So you'll recognize him if you see him?"

74
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:51,088
asked Wukong, trying not to laugh.

75
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:53,390
"Certainly," said the monk.

76
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:56,313
"Why do you ask?"

77
00:04:56,314 --> 00:04:58,602
Light sparkled around Wukong.

78
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:01,774
A moment later he was a monkey again.

79
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:05,637
"Sun Wukong!" cried the monks.

80
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:12,124
They all fell to their knees and bowed.
