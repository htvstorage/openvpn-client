1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:15,005
The man on the road continued to wave a warning.

2
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:19,078
Trembling with fear, the Tang Monk fell from his horse.

3
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,790
Wujing rushed over to help him stand up.

4
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,984
"I'll be right back," said Wukong.

5
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:29,596
"I'll ask that man what sort of danger is up ahead."

6
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:36,990
The monkey walked toward the man.

7
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:43,963
Looking closely, Wukong could tell that he was not an ordinary man.

8
00:00:43,964 --> 00:00:47,537
"Hello, Venus," said Wukong with a smile.

9
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:49,128
[g@The man smiled back.

10
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:52,817
"Yes, it's me, the spirit of the planet Venus.@g]

11
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:56,233
I came in disguise to warn you, Wukong.

12
00:00:56,234 --> 00:01:00,724
There are three powerful demons on the mountain up ahead.

13
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:03,215
The first is a lion demon.

14
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:05,869
[g@The second is an elephant demon.

15
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,630
And the third is a raptor demon."@g]

16
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:10,972
[g@The monkey shrugged.

17
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:12,738
"Thanks for the warning, Venus.@g]

18
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,750
But I'm not worried about three silly demons."

19
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:18,328
Venus shook his head.

20
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:19,859
[g@"You should be worried.

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,973
The three demons command a demon army."@g]

22
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:26,293
[g@Wukong rubbed his chin.

23
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,636
"Once again, thank you for the warning.@g]

24
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:33,512
But even an entire army of demons doesn't worry me."

25
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:38,538
[g@Venus nodded. "Very well, Wukong. Good luck!"

26
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,785
The spirit vanished.@g]

27
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:46,716
The monkey walked back to his companions.

28
00:01:46,717 --> 00:01:50,503
[g@"Well?" said Bajie. "What did the man say?

29
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:52,674
Is there danger up ahead?"@g]

30
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:56,770
"Are there demons?" asked the Tang Monk, still scared.

31
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:59,776
"Actually, yes," said Wukong.

32
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:01,798
[g@"There's an army of demons.

33
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,458
But I'm not worried."@g]

34
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,383
[g@The Tang Monk's jaw dropped.

35
00:02:07,384 --> 00:02:09,881
"How can you not be worried?"@g]

36
00:02:09,882 --> 00:02:13,607
Wukong laughed. "Master, have you forgotten?

37
00:02:13,608 --> 00:02:17,006
I once defeated Heaven's entire army."

38
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:22,185
Wujing frowned. "Yes, we all know about that, Wukong.

39
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:24,112
[g@But this is different.

40
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:28,038
The Tang Monk is with usâ€”we must keep him safe."@g]

41
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:33,170
Bajie nodded. "Yes, and I'd like to be safe too."

42
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:36,929
[g@Wukong sighed. "You're right.

43
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,720
We can't let the demons harm Master."@g]

44
00:02:40,721 --> 00:02:44,527
[g@He gave a sideways glance at Bajie and smirked.

45
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:46,372
"Or the pig."@g]

46
00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:48,521
Bajie snorted.

47
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:51,165
"You all wait here," said Wukong.

48
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:56,473
"I'll check out the mountain to see how big the demon army is."

49
00:02:56,474 --> 00:03:02,241
The monkey flew to the mountain.

50
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:05,559
Several demons were talking in front of a cave.

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,949
They were dressed like military officers.

52
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,776
Wukong spied on them from behind a rock.

53
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:17,624
"The Tang Monk will be coming over our [n@mountain soon," said a demon general.

54
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,319
"Our leaders want all the troops to watch for him."

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,201
"I hope we catch the Tang Monk," said a captain.

56
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:29,640
"I've heard that anyone who eats him will live forever."

57
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:31,522
[g@Wukong was furious.

58
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:34,628
"How dare they plan to eat Master!"@g]

59
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,264
The demons were still talking.

60
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:41,000
"But who will get to eat the monk?" asked another captain.

61
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:44,263
"There are thousands of troops in our army."

62
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:47,704
"We'll all get to eat him," said the general.

63
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:52,077
"Our leaders promised to share him with the entire army."

64
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:55,496
The other officers nodded and smiled.

65
00:03:55,497 --> 00:04:00,548
"That was very kind of our leaders," said a captain.

66
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:04,297
"We must be careful though," warned the general.

67
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:06,707
"Why?" asked a colonel.

68
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,960
[g@"The monk is just a man.

69
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:12,117
He can't possibly stop us."@g]

70
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:17,024
"I've heard that the Tang Monk isn't alone," said the general.

71
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:20,589
"Sun Wukong is with him."

72
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,033
Everyone grew quiet.

73
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:28,246
"He's the spirit who defeated Heaven's entire army," whispered a captain.

74
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:29,922
[g@Another captain nodded.

75
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:31,745
"He is quite powerful."@g]

76
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:35,466
Wukong beamed proudly when he heard that.

77
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:39,243
"Don't worry about Sun Wukong," said the general.

78
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:42,903
"Just tell the troops to watch for the Tang Monk."

79
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:45,805
"Yes, General," said the colonel.

80
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:49,165
"I have an idea," thought Wukong.

81
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:54,854
The monkey made himself look like a demon general.

82
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:59,872
Then he stepped out from behind the rock and hurried over to the officers.

83
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:03,473
"I have good news!" shouted Wukong.

84
00:05:03,474 --> 00:05:11,587
"The Tang Monk is heading toward our mountain!"
