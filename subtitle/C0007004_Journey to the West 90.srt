00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 113:06:50,933.3330000042915
The man on the road continued to wave a warning.

2
113:08:30,933.3330000042915 --> 226:15:10,933.3329999446869
Trembling with fear, the Tang Monk fell from his horse.

3
226:16:50,933.3329999446869 --> 329:21:50,933.3329999446869
Wujing rushed over to help him stand up.

4
329:23:30,933.3329999446869 --> 418:05:10,933.3329999446869
"I'll be right back," said Wukong.

5
418:06:50,933.3329999446869 --> 518:25:10,933.3329999446869
"I'll ask that man what sort of danger is up ahead."

6
518:26:50,933.3329999446869 --> 723:48:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey walked toward the man.

7
723:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 917:30:10,933.3330001831055
Looking closely, Wukong could tell that he was not an ordinary man.

8
917:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1016:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Hello, Venus," said Wukong with a smile.

9
1016:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1060:58:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The man smiled back.

10
1061:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1163:26:50,933.3330001831055
"Yes, it's me, the spirit of the planet Venus.@g]

11
1163:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1258:20:10,933.3330001831055
I came in disguise to warn you, Wukong.

12
1258:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1383:05:10,933.3330001831055
There are three powerful demons on the mountain up ahead.

13
1383:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1452:16:50,933.3330001831055
The first is a lion demon.

14
1452:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1526:00:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The second is an elephant demon.

15
1526:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1630:28:30,933.3330001831055
And the third is a raptor demon."@g]

16
1630:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1667:45:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The monkey shrugged.

17
1667:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1716:48:30,933.3330001831055
"Thanks for the warning, Venus.@g]

18
1716:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1828:15:10,933.3330001831055
But I'm not worried about three silly demons."

19
1828:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1872:05:10,933.3330001831055
Venus shook his head.

20
1872:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1914:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"You should be worried.

21
1914:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2028:53:30,933.3330001831055
The three demons command a demon army."@g]

22
2028:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2093:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong rubbed his chin.

23
2093:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2158:25:10,933.3330001831055
"Once again, thank you for the warning.@g]

24
2158:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2293:51:50,933.3330001831055
But even an entire army of demons doesn't worry me."

25
2293:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2433:28:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Venus nodded. "Very well, Wukong. Good luck!"

26
2433:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2495:53:30,933.3330001831055
The spirit vanished.@g]

27
2495:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2660:38:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey walked back to his companions.

28
2660:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2765:50:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Well?" said Bajie. "What did the man say?

29
2765:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2826:08:30,933.3330001831055
Is there danger up ahead?"@g]

30
2826:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2939:55:10,933.3330001831055
"Are there demons?" asked the Tang Monk, still scared.

31
2939:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3023:25:10,933.3330001831055
"Actually, yes," said Wukong.

32
3023:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3079:35:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"There's an army of demons.

33
3079:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3153:28:30,933.3330001831055
But I'm not worried."@g]

34
3153:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3234:43:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk's jaw dropped.

35
3234:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3304:06:50,933.3330001831055
"How can you not be worried?"@g]

36
3304:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3407:36:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong laughed. "Master, have you forgotten?

37
3407:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3502:01:50,933.3330001831055
I once defeated Heaven's entire army."

38
3502:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3645:53:30,933.3330001831055
Wujing frowned. "Yes, we all know about that, Wukong.

39
3645:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3699:25:10,933.3330001831055
[g@But this is different.

40
3699:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3808:28:30,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk is with usâ€”we must keep him safe."@g]

41
3808:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3951:01:50,933.3330001831055
Bajie nodded. "Yes, and I'd like to be safe too."

42
3951:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4055:26:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong sighed. "You're right.

43
4055:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4160:45:10,933.3330001831055
We can't let the demons harm Master."@g]

44
4160:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4266:30:10,933.3330001831055
[g@He gave a sideways glance at Bajie and smirked.

45
4266:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4317:45:10,933.3330001831055
"Or the pig."@g]

46
4317:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4377:26:50,933.3330001831055
Bajie snorted.

47
4377:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4450:53:30,933.3330001831055
"You all wait here," said Wukong.

48
4450:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4598:20:10,933.3330001831055
"I'll check out the mountain to see how big the demon army is."

49
4598:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4758:33:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey flew to the mountain.

50
4758:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4850:43:30,933.3330001831055
Several demons were talking in front of a cave.

51
4850:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4944:53:30,933.3330001831055
They were dressed like military officers.

52
4944:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5051:11:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong spied on them from behind a rock.

53
5051:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5185:51:50,933.3330001831055
"The Tang Monk will be coming over our [n@mountain soon," said a demon general.

54
5185:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5288:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Our leaders want all the troops to watch for him."

55
5288:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5396:20:10,933.3330001831055
"I hope we catch the Tang Monk," said a captain.

56
5396:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5519:38:30,933.3330001831055
"I've heard that anyone who eats him will live forever."

57
5519:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5571:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong was furious.

58
5571:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5658:11:50,933.3330001831055
"How dare they plan to eat Master!"@g]

59
5658:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5731:25:10,933.3330001831055
The demons were still talking.

60
5731:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5835:11:50,933.3330001831055
"But who will get to eat the monk?" asked another captain.

61
5835:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5925:50:10,933.3330001831055
"There are thousands of troops in our army."

62
5925:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6021:25:10,933.3330001831055
"We'll all get to eat him," said the general.

63
6021:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6142:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Our leaders promised to share him with the entire army."

64
6142:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6237:51:50,933.3330001831055
The other officers nodded and smiled.

65
6237:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6378:11:50,933.3330001831055
"That was very kind of our leaders," said a captain.

66
6378:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6482:20:10,933.3330001831055
"We must be careful though," warned the general.

67
6482:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6549:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Why?" asked a colonel.

68
6549:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6611:51:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"The monk is just a man.

69
6611:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6699:33:30,933.3330001831055
He can't possibly stop us."@g]

70
6699:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6835:51:50,933.3330001831055
"I've heard that the Tang Monk isn't alone," said the general.

71
6835:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6934:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Sun Wukong is with him."

72
6934:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7002:46:50,933.3330001831055
Everyone grew quiet.

73
7002:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7147:35:10,933.3330001831055
"He's the spirit who defeated Heaven's entire army," whispered a captain.

74
7147:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7194:08:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Another captain nodded.

75
7194:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7244:46:50,933.3330001831055
"He is quite powerful."@g]

76
7244:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7348:08:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong beamed proudly when he heard that.

77
7348:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7453:03:30,933.3330001831055
"Don't worry about Sun Wukong," said the general.

78
7453:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7554:43:30,933.3330001831055
"Just tell the troops to watch for the Tang Monk."

79
7554:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7635:20:10,933.3330001831055
"Yes, General," said the colonel.

80
7635:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7728:40:10,933.3330001831055
"I have an idea," thought Wukong.

81
7728:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7886:41:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey made himself look like a demon general.

82
7886:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8026:05:10,933.3330001831055
Then he stepped out from behind the rock and hurried over to the officers.

83
8026:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8126:06:50,933.3330001831055
"I have good news!" shouted Wukong.

84
8126:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8351:30:10,933.3330001831055
"The Tang Monk is heading toward our mountain!"
