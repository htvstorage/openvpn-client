1
00:00:11,000 --> 163:03:31,000
Bajie didn't know Guanyin was really Red Boy in disguise.

2
163:05:11,000 --> 284:10:11,000
"The Tang Monk is in trouble," said the pig to the fake Guanyin.

3
284:11:51,000 --> 391:18:31,000
[g@"A demon named Red Boy is planning to eat him.

4
391:20:11,000 --> 448:41:51,000
Can you help us?"@g]

5
448:43:31,000 --> 535:11:51,000
[g@"Of course," said the fake Guanyin.

6
535:13:31,000 --> 583:58:31,000
"I know Red Boy.@g]

7
584:00:11,000 --> 638:35:11,000
[g@He's very nice.

8
638:36:51,000 --> 768:23:31,000
I doubt he'll harm the Tang Monk.@g]

9
768:25:11,000 --> 1000:16:51,000
Let's go to Red Boy's cave and talk to him."

10
1000:18:31,000 --> 1180:08:31,000
[g@Bajie and the fake Guanyin flew to Red Boy's cave.

11
1180:10:11,000 --> 1327:18:31,000
Bajie went in first.@g]

12
1327:20:11,000 --> 1508:08:31,000
Red Boy returned to his normal appearance [n@and then sneaked up behind Bajie.

13
1508:10:11,000 --> 1580:43:31,000
He threw a sack over the pig.

14
1580:45:11,000 --> 1684:23:31,000
"Hey, what's going on?" shouted Bajie.

15
1684:25:11,000 --> 1776:31:51,000
[g@"I'm not Guanyin, you fool!"

16
1776:33:31,000 --> 1823:31:51,000
The demon laughed.@g]

17
1823:33:31,000 --> 1871:30:11,000
[g@"I'm Red Boy!

18
1871:31:51,000 --> 2057:03:31,000
And now you're trapped!"@g]

19
2057:05:11,000 --> 2212:23:31,000
The demon locked Bajie in a room.

20
2212:25:11,000 --> 2313:51:51,000
"Why isn't Bajie back yet?" asked Wujing.

21
2313:53:31,000 --> 2437:35:11,000
[g@Wukong frowned. "He probably stopped to take a nap.

22
2437:36:51,000 --> 2513:56:51,000
That pig is so lazy."@g]

23
2513:58:31,000 --> 2609:28:31,000
[g@Wujing nodded. "Yes, he's very lazy.

24
2609:30:11,000 --> 2680:06:51,000
What should we do now?"@g]

25
2680:08:31,000 --> 2808:58:31,000
"I'm going to sneak into Red Boy's cave," said Wukong.

26
2809:00:11,000 --> 2905:26:51,000
"I want to make sure the Tang Monk is still alive.

27
2905:28:31,000 --> 2981:25:11,000
Then I'll go to Guanyin myself."

28
2981:26:51,000 --> 3172:23:31,000
The monkey turned himself into a bee and flew up the mountain.

29
3172:25:11,000 --> 3311:55:11,000
He slipped through the cave door and flew down a long tunnel.

30
3311:56:51,000 --> 3446:56:51,000
Soon he heard the Tang Monk crying.

31
3446:58:31,000 --> 3542:53:31,000
"Master is scared," thought Wukong.

32
3542:55:11,000 --> 3606:36:51,000
[g@"But at least he's still alive."

33
3606:38:31,000 --> 3670:55:11,000
The monkey then heard a shout.@g]

34
3670:56:51,000 --> 3760:58:31,000
It was Bajie. "You filthy demon!

35
3761:00:11,000 --> 3881:11:51,000
How dare you make yourself look like Guanyin and fool me!"

36
3881:13:31,000 --> 4009:06:51,000
"Aha!" thought Wukong. "Bajie didn't take a nap after all.

37
4009:08:31,000 --> 4122:26:51,000
I must go to the real Guanyin right away."

38
4122:28:31,000 --> 4280:43:31,000
The monkey flew out of the cave and told Wujing what he'd just learned.

39
4280:45:11,000 --> 4432:16:51,000
Then he jumped onto a cloud and headed south.

40
4432:18:31,000 --> 4636:28:31,000
He found Guanyin in her pagoda.

41
4636:30:11,000 --> 4750:55:11,000
"Wukong, why are you here?" asked Guanyin.

42
4750:56:51,000 --> 4853:41:51,000
"We have a problem, Bodhisattva," said the monkey.

43
4853:43:31,000 --> 4965:46:51,000
"The Tang Monk was caught by a demon named Red Boy.

44
4965:48:31,000 --> 5086:28:31,000
The demon makes magic fire that water can't put out.

45
5086:30:11,000 --> 5191:28:31,000
Bajie was on his way here to ask for your help.

46
5191:30:11,000 --> 5299:36:51,000
But the demon made himself look like you and tricked the pig."

47
5299:38:31,000 --> 5393:50:11,000
Guanyin's face burned with anger.

48
5393:51:51,000 --> 5518:41:51,000
"How dare that demon make himself look like me!"

49
5518:43:31,000 --> 5755:20:11,000
The bodhisattva grabbed a vase and stormed outside.

50
5755:21:51,000 --> 5948:41:51,000
She threw the vase down into the ocean, where it sank beneath the waves.

51
5948:43:31,000 --> 6084:35:11,000
Wukong gasped. "That vase was a Buddhist treasure!

52
6084:36:51,000 --> 6141:55:11,000
Why did you throw it away?"

53
6141:56:51,000 --> 6193:35:11,000
[g@Guanyin didn't answer.

54
6193:36:51,000 --> 6281:15:11,000
A minute later the water rumbled.@g]

55
6281:16:51,000 --> 6341:01:51,000
[g@The vase reappeared.

56
6341:03:31,000 --> 6520:35:11,000
It was atop the shell of a giant turtle.@g]

57
6520:36:51,000 --> 6654:21:51,000
The turtle came onto the shore and bowed its head.

58
6654:23:31,000 --> 6797:45:11,000
"Go down and get the vase, Wukong," said Guanyin.

59
6797:46:51,000 --> 6980:31:51,000
The monkey ran down the mountain and tried to pick up the vase.

60
6980:33:31,000 --> 7159:16:51,000
"Grr!" Wukong grunted and used all of his strength.

61
7159:18:31,000 --> 7320:50:11,000
But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't lift the vase at all.

62
7320:51:51,000 --> 7445:06:51,000
"Bodhisattva!" he called. "I don't understand.

63
7445:08:31,000 --> 7609:58:31,000
It's just a small vase, but I can't lift it!"

64
7610:00:11,000 --> 7702:35:11,000
Guanyin came down the mountain.

65
7702:36:51,000 --> 7861:06:51,000
"That vase just traveled around the world, through all the oceans and rivers.

66
7861:08:31,000 --> 8022:50:11,000
It now holds an ocean's worth of waterâ€”magic water.

67
8022:51:51,000 --> 8207:30:11,000
The water will put out Red Boy's fire."

68
8207:31:51,000 --> 8326:18:31,000
Guanyin picked up the vase with one hand.

69
8326:20:11,000 --> 8475:53:31,000
She held up her other hand, and several swords appeared.

70
8475:55:11,000 --> 8694:36:51,000
She waved them, and they turned into a large lotus platform.

71
8694:38:31,000 --> 8931:16:51,000
"I have what I need now," said Guanyin. "Let's go."
