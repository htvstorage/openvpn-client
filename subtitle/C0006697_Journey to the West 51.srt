1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,870
Bajie didn't know Guanyin was really Red Boy in disguise.

2
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:21,230
"The Tang Monk is in trouble," said the pig to the fake Guanyin.

3
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:25,087
"A demon named Red Boy is planning to eat him.

4
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,153
Can you help us?"

5
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:30,267
"Of course," said the fake Guanyin.

6
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:32,023
"I know Red Boy.

7
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,989
He's very nice.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,662
I doubt he'll harm the Tang Monk.

9
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:47,010
Let's go to Red Boy's cave and talk to him."

10
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:53,485
Bajie and the fake Guanyin flew to Red Boy's cave.

11
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:58,783
Bajie went in first.

12
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:05,293
Red Boy returned to his normal appearance and then sneaked up behind Bajie.

13
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:07,906
He threw a sack over the pig.

14
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:11,638
"Hey, what's going on?" shouted Bajie.

15
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:14,955
"I'm not Guanyin, you fool!"

16
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:16,647
The demon laughed.

17
00:01:16,648 --> 00:01:18,374
"I'm Red Boy!

18
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:25,054
And now you're trapped!"

19
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:30,646
The demon locked Bajie in a room.

20
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:34,299
"Why isn't Bajie back yet?" asked Wujing.

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,753
Wukong frowned. "He probably stopped to take a nap.

22
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:41,502
That pig is so lazy."

23
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:44,941
Wujing nodded. "Yes, he's very lazy.

24
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:47,484
What should we do now?"

25
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:52,123
"I'm going to sneak into Red Boy's cave," said Wukong.

26
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:55,596
"I want to make sure the Tang Monk is still alive.

27
00:01:55,597 --> 00:01:58,331
Then I'll go to Guanyin myself."

28
00:01:58,332 --> 00:02:05,206
The monkey turned himself into a bee and flew up the mountain.

29
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:10,229
He slipped through the cave door and flew down a long tunnel.

30
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,090
Soon he heard the Tang Monk crying.

31
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:18,544
"Master is scared," thought Wukong.

32
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:20,838
"But at least he's still alive."

33
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:23,153
The monkey then heard a shout.

34
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:26,395
It was Bajie. "You filthy demon!

35
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,723
How dare you make yourself look like Guanyin and fool me!"

36
00:02:30,724 --> 00:02:35,328
"Aha!" thought Wukong. "Bajie didn't take a nap after all.

37
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:39,408
I must go to the real Guanyin right away."

38
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:45,106
The monkey flew out of the cave and told Wujing what he'd just learned.

39
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:50,562
Then he jumped onto a cloud and headed south.

40
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:57,913
He found Guanyin in her pagoda.

41
00:02:57,914 --> 00:03:02,033
"Wukong, why are you here?" asked Guanyin.

42
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:05,733
"We have a problem, Bodhisattva," said the monkey.

43
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:09,768
"The Tang Monk was caught by a demon named Red Boy.

44
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:14,113
The demon makes magic fire that water can't put out.

45
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:17,893
Bajie was on his way here to ask for your help.

46
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:21,786
But the demon made himself look like you and tricked the pig."

47
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:25,178
Guanyin's face burned with anger.

48
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:29,673
"How dare that demon make himself look like me!"

49
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:38,192
The bodhisattva grabbed a vase and stormed outside.

50
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:45,153
She threw the vase down into the ocean, where it sank beneath the waves.

51
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:50,045
Wukong gasped. "That vase was a Buddhist treasure!

52
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:52,109
Why did you throw it away?"

53
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,969
Guanyin didn't answer.

54
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,125
A minute later the water rumbled.

55
00:03:57,126 --> 00:03:59,277
The vase reappeared.

56
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:05,741
It was atop the shell of a giant turtle.

57
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:10,557
The turtle came onto the shore and bowed its head.

58
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:15,719
"Go down and get the vase, Wukong," said Guanyin.

59
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,299
The monkey ran down the mountain and tried to pick up the vase.

60
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,734
"Grr!" Wukong grunted and used all of his strength.

61
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:34,550
But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't lift the vase at all.

62
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:39,024
"Bodhisattva!" he called. "I don't understand.

63
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:44,959
It's just a small vase, but I can't lift it!"

64
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,293
Guanyin came down the mountain.

65
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:54,000
"That vase just traveled around the world, through all the oceans and rivers.

66
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:59,822
It now holds an ocean's worth of waterâ€”magic water.

67
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:06,470
The water will put out Red Boy's fire."

68
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:10,747
Guanyin picked up the vase with one hand.

69
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:16,132
She held up her other hand, and several swords appeared.

70
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:24,006
She waved them, and they turned into a large lotus platform.

71
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:32,526
"I have what I need now," said Guanyin. "Let's go."
