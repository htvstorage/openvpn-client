1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,950
The creature had a pig's snout and ears.

2
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:20,081
But he ran on two legs like a person.

3
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:22,072
He swung the rake again.

4
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:25,252
Wukong blocked the rake with his iron bar.

5
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:29,397
Clang! Then he swung the bar at the pig's feet.

6
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:31,649
"Oof!" cried the pig.

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,471
He fell facedown in the dirt.

8
00:00:34,472 --> 00:00:36,250
He jumped back up.

9
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:39,700
"You'll wish you hadn't done that!"

10
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:48,888
Wukong leaped out of the way as the pig's rake slammed down, smashing a boulder.

11
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:54,532
The two fought, kicking up dust and rocks.

12
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:57,554
The Tang Monk hid behind his horse.

13
00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:02,472
"Surrender now!" Wukong swung his iron bar again.

14
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:04,652
"I am Sun Wukong.

15
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:08,548
Five hundred years ago, I caused lots of trouble in Heaven.

16
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,113
The Jade Emperor's entire army couldn't stop me!"

17
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,637
"I've heard of you," said the pig.

18
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:18,478
"But you don't seem so powerful to me!"

19
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,183
He lunged at the monkey again.

20
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:23,617
Wukong jumped out of the way.

21
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:26,710
"I thought you were being punished," said the pig.

22
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,923
He swung his rake again.

23
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:31,585
"Weren't you trapped under a mountain?"

24
00:01:31,586 --> 00:01:34,150
"I'm free now," said Wukong.

25
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:37,088
"I'm going to the West with the Tang Monk toâ€”"

26
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:39,704
"The Tang Monk!" cried the pig.

27
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:41,922
He dropped his rake.

28
00:01:41,923 --> 00:01:44,461
"I'm supposed to go with him too!"

29
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:47,750
"You are?" asked Wukong.

30
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:51,538
"I was sent to Earth as a punishment," said the pig.

31
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:55,520
"My name is Zhu Bajie.

32
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:58,374
I caused trouble in Heaven too.

33
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:05,729
Guanyin said I would be forgiven if I helped protect the Tang Monk."

34
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,805
Wukong rubbed his chin.

35
00:02:07,806 --> 00:02:14,198
"Okay," he said. "You can carry the bags."

36
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:19,595
Zhu Bajie joined the group, and the three of them continued west.

37
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:23,751
As they traveled, the pig kept complaining.

38
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:27,291
"These bags are so heavy!

39
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:30,538
Do we really need to bring them?"

40
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,072
"Stop complaining," snapped Wukong.

41
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:38,187
"Going to the Western Paradise is supposed to be difficult."

42
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:42,281
The pig moaned. "I'm hungry too.

43
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:44,785
When are we going to eat lunch?"

44
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:46,887
The Tang Monk frowned.

45
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:48,811
"We just ate breakfast.

46
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:51,573
How can you be hungry again?"

47
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:56,613
They went around a bend and saw a large tiger.

48
00:02:56,614 --> 00:03:00,560
Bajie and Wukong quickly pulled out their weapons.

49
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:03,319
"Who are you?" yelled Bajie.

50
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,954
"What are you doing here?"

51
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:12,323
"My master, the great king Yellow Wind, is hosting a feast," said the tiger.

52
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:15,273
He looked at the Tang Monk.

53
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:18,759
"I'm gathering people to eat."

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,949
The Tang Monk's face turned pale, and he fell off his horse.

55
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,816
"Don't you dare harm our master!" Bajie warned.

56
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:29,566
"He is the Tang Monk.

57
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:33,194
He's going to the West to get the True Scriptures."

58
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:36,005
The tiger's eyes opened wide.

59
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:41,014
"I heard that eating the Tang Monk will make someone live forever."

60
00:03:41,015 --> 00:03:44,583
The tiger showed his claws.

61
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:47,145
Then he lunged at Bajie.

62
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:49,442
The pig hit him with the rake.

63
00:03:49,443 --> 00:03:52,137
The tiger tumbled over.

64
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:55,679
Wukong ran toward the tiger with his iron bar.

65
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,279
The tiger dodged the bar and then almost got hit by the rake again.

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,045
He turned and fled.

67
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:08,532
Wukong and Bajie ran after the tiger.

68
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:11,395
For a moment they lost him.

69
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:16,366
Then they spotted a flash of orange behind some bushes.

70
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:19,564
"There he is!" whispered Bajie.

71
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:23,107
The monkey and pig sneaked up to the bushes.

72
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:25,313
But the tiger wasn't there.

73
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:32,857
Instead a tiger skin lay over a rock.

74
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:38,523
Wukong laughed. "He was so scared, he ran right out of his skin!"

75
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:40,885
He slapped Bajie on the back.

76
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:45,818
"We are great protectors!"

77
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:50,599
The two friends walked back to the road, laughing.

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,914
But suddenly their laughter stopped.

79
00:04:53,915 --> 00:05:03,028
"Oh no!" cried Wukong. "Where is the Tang Monk?"
