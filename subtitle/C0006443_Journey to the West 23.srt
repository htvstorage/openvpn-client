1
00:00:11,200 --> 159:43:31,200
The creature had a pig's snout and ears.

2
159:45:11,200 --> 246:41:51,200
[g@But he ran on two legs like a person.

3
246:43:31,200 --> 302:00:11,200
He swung the rake again.@g]

4
302:01:51,200 --> 390:20:11,200
Wukong blocked the rake with his iron bar.

5
390:21:51,200 --> 505:28:31,200
[i@Clang!@i] Then he swung the bar at the pig's feet.

6
505:30:11,200 --> 568:01:51,200
[g@"Oof!" cried the pig.

7
568:03:31,200 --> 646:25:11,200
He fell facedown in the dirt.@g]

8
646:26:51,200 --> 695:50:11,200
[g@He jumped back up.

9
695:51:51,200 --> 791:40:11,200
"You'll wish you hadn't done that!"@g]

10
791:41:51,200 --> 1046:53:31,200
Wukong leaped out of the way as the pig's [n@rake slammed down, smashing a boulder.

11
1046:55:11,200 --> 1203:40:11,200
The two fought, kicking up dust and rocks.

12
1203:41:51,200 --> 1287:36:51,200
The Tang Monk hid behind his horse.

13
1287:38:31,200 --> 1424:13:31,200
[g@"Surrender now!" Wukong swung his iron bar again.

14
1424:15:11,200 --> 1484:46:51,200
"I am Sun Wukong.@g]

15
1484:48:31,200 --> 1593:00:11,200
Five hundred years ago, I caused lots of trouble in Heaven.

16
1593:01:51,200 --> 1719:48:31,200
The Jade Emperor's entire army couldn't stop me!"

17
1719:50:11,200 --> 1789:55:11,200
[g@"I've heard of you," said the pig.

18
1789:56:51,200 --> 1868:50:11,200
"But you don't seem so powerful to me!"@g]

19
1868:51:51,200 --> 1943:58:31,200
[g@He lunged at the monkey again.

20
1944:00:11,200 --> 2011:35:11,200
Wukong jumped out of the way.@g]

21
2011:36:51,200 --> 2097:30:11,200
"I thought you were being punished," said the pig.

22
2097:31:51,200 --> 2158:58:31,200
[g@He swung his rake again.

23
2159:00:11,200 --> 2232:55:11,200
"Weren't you trapped under a mountain?"@g]

24
2232:56:51,200 --> 2304:10:11,200
"I'm free now," said Wukong.

25
2304:11:51,200 --> 2385:46:51,200
"I'm going to the West with the Tang Monk toâ€”"

26
2385:48:31,200 --> 2458:26:51,200
[g@"The Tang Monk!" cried the pig.

27
2458:28:31,200 --> 2520:03:31,200
He dropped his rake.@g]

28
2520:05:11,200 --> 2590:35:11,200
"I'm supposed to go with him too!"

29
2590:36:51,200 --> 2681:56:51,200
"You are?" asked Wukong.

30
2681:58:31,200 --> 2787:10:11,200
"I was sent to Earth as a punishment," said the pig.

31
2787:11:51,200 --> 2897:46:51,200
[g@"My name is Zhu Bajie.

32
2897:48:31,200 --> 2977:03:31,200
I caused trouble in Heaven too.@g]

33
2977:05:11,200 --> 3181:21:51,200
Guanyin said I would be forgiven if I helped protect the Tang Monk."

34
3181:23:31,200 --> 3239:01:51,200
[g@Wukong rubbed his chin.

35
3239:03:31,200 --> 3416:36:51,200
"Okay," he said. "You can carry the bags."@g]

36
3416:38:31,200 --> 3566:31:51,200
Zhu Bajie joined the group, and the three of them continued west.

37
3566:33:31,200 --> 3681:58:31,200
As they traveled, the pig kept complaining.

38
3682:00:11,200 --> 3780:18:31,200
[g@"These bags are so heavy!

39
3780:20:11,200 --> 3870:30:11,200
Do we really need to bring them?"@g]

40
3870:31:51,200 --> 3940:53:31,200
"Stop complaining," snapped Wukong.

41
3940:55:11,200 --> 4082:58:31,200
"Going to the Western Paradise is [i@supposed@i] to be difficult."

42
4083:00:11,200 --> 4196:41:51,200
[g@The pig moaned. "I'm hungry too.

43
4196:43:31,200 --> 4266:15:11,200
When are we going to eat lunch?"@g]

44
4266:16:51,200 --> 4324:38:31,200
The Tang Monk frowned.

45
4324:40:11,200 --> 4378:05:11,200
[g@"We just ate breakfast.

46
4378:06:51,200 --> 4454:48:31,200
How can you be hungry again?"@g]

47
4454:50:11,200 --> 4594:48:31,200
They went around a bend and saw a large tiger.

48
4594:50:11,200 --> 4704:26:51,200
Bajie and Wukong quickly pulled out their weapons.

49
4704:28:31,200 --> 4781:05:11,200
[g@"Who are you?" yelled Bajie.

50
4781:06:51,200 --> 4854:16:51,200
"What are you doing here?"@g]

51
4854:18:31,200 --> 5031:11:51,200
"My master, the great king Yellow Wind, [n@is hosting a feast," said the tiger.

52
5031:13:31,200 --> 5113:08:31,200
[g@He looked at the Tang Monk.

53
5113:10:11,200 --> 5209:58:31,200
"I'm gathering people to eat."@g]

54
5210:00:11,200 --> 5354:08:31,200
The Tang Monk's face turned pale, and he fell off his horse.

55
5354:10:11,200 --> 5461:33:31,200
"Don't you dare harm our master!" Bajie warned.

56
5461:35:11,200 --> 5510:10:11,200
[g@"He is the Tang Monk.

57
5510:11:51,200 --> 5610:56:51,200
He's going to the West to get the True Scriptures."@g]

58
5610:58:31,200 --> 5689:01:51,200
The tiger's eyes opened wide.

59
5689:03:31,200 --> 5828:10:11,200
"I heard that eating the Tang Monk will make someone live forever."

60
5828:11:51,200 --> 5927:18:31,200
[g@The tiger showed his claws.

61
5927:20:11,200 --> 5998:28:31,200
Then he lunged at Bajie.@g]

62
5998:30:11,200 --> 6062:16:51,200
[g@The pig hit him with the rake.

63
6062:18:31,200 --> 6137:08:31,200
The tiger tumbled over.@g]

64
6137:10:11,200 --> 6235:31:51,200
Wukong ran toward the tiger with his iron bar.

65
6235:33:31,200 --> 6363:18:31,200
The tiger dodged the bar and then almost got hit by the rake again.

66
6363:20:11,200 --> 6440:08:31,200
He turned and fled.

67
6440:10:11,200 --> 6592:33:31,200
[g@Wukong and Bajie ran after the tiger.

68
6592:35:11,200 --> 6672:05:11,200
For a moment they lost him.@g]

69
6672:06:51,200 --> 6810:10:11,200
Then they spotted a flash of orange behind some bushes.

70
6810:11:51,200 --> 6899:00:11,200
"There he is!" whispered Bajie.

71
6899:01:51,200 --> 6997:25:11,200
The monkey and pig sneaked up to the bushes.

72
6997:26:51,200 --> 7058:41:51,200
[g@But the tiger wasn't there.

73
7058:43:31,200 --> 7268:15:11,200
Instead a tiger skin lay over a rock.@g]

74
7268:16:51,200 --> 7425:38:31,200
Wukong laughed. "He was so scared, he ran right out of his skin!"

75
7425:40:11,200 --> 7491:15:11,200
[g@He slapped Bajie on the back.

76
7491:16:51,200 --> 7628:16:51,200
"We are great protectors!"@g]

77
7628:18:31,200 --> 7761:05:11,200
The two friends walked back to the road, laughing.

78
7761:06:51,200 --> 7853:10:11,200
But suddenly their laughter stopped.

79
7853:11:51,200 --> 8106:20:11,200
"Oh no!" cried Wukong. "Where is the Tang Monk?"
