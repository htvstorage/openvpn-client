1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:17,649
"What happened here?" Wukong asked the gibbon.

2
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,233
A few more monkeys and apes gathered around Sun Wukong and the gibbon.

3
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:24,188
They looked scared.

4
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:27,056
"A demon attacked us," said the gibbon.

5
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:30,393
"We tried to fight him, but he was too powerful.

6
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:34,163
He stole most of our things and kidnapped many of us."

7
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:36,490
[g@Wukong was furious.

8
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:39,071
"Who is he? Where does he live?"@g]

9
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:42,588
"He is called the Demon of Chaos," said the gibbon.

10
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:45,487
"He came from the north."

11
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:50,312
"Wait here," Wukong ordered. "I will handle the demon."

12
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:53,628
"The demon is very powerful," the gibbon warned.

13
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:57,720
"I learned many things from a sage," Wukong replied.

14
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:00,654
[g@"I am now as powerful as a god!

15
00:01:00,655 --> 00:01:03,180
I'm not afraid of any demon.@g]

16
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:05,606
I'll be back soon."

17
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:10,586
He leaped into the air and flew north.

18
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:13,337
His subjects stared in amazement.

19
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:17,526
"Our king can fly!" said the gibbon.

20
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:20,999
[g@Wukong soon spotted a gloomy mountain.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,113
Dark clouds hung over it.@g]

22
00:01:24,114 --> 00:01:29,207
"That looks like a demon's home," he thought.

23
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:32,825
Wukong landed on the mountain and found a cave.

24
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:37,770
Two guards stood at the entrance, practicing sword fighting.

25
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:42,098
"I'm king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain!" yelled Wukong.

26
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:45,041
[g@"The Demon of Chaos attacked my subjects!

27
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:49,634
I want revenge!"@g]

28
00:01:49,635 --> 00:01:54,998
"Ahh!" the guards shrieked, and ran into the cave.

29
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:59,023
The Demon of Chaos was sitting at a table, eating a meal.

30
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:01,917
"Disaster!" one guard cried.

31
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:06,173
"What sort of disaster?" asked the demon.

32
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:09,957
"There's a monkey outside," said the other guard.

33
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:13,119
"He said he's king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,504
[g@You attacked his subjects.

35
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:18,726
Now he wants revenge!"@g]

36
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:23,294
"The monkeys and apes have spoken of a king," said the demon.

37
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,418
[g@"He left to find a sage.

38
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:27,929
I guess he returned."@g]

39
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,773
[g@The demon stood up.

40
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:33,188
"Does the monkey have any weapons?"@g]

41
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:36,114
"No," said one guard.

42
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:41,055
"Then get me my armor and my sword," said the demon.

43
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:48,744
A moment later the Demon of Chaos walked outside.

44
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:51,411
[g@He looked at Wukong and laughed.

45
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:54,871
"You're just a little monkey!" he said.@g]

46
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:58,036
Wukong looked up at the huge demon.

47
00:02:58,037 --> 00:03:04,945
"I am small," he said, "but I am more powerful than you can imagine."

48
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:08,415
[g@"I'm not afraid of you!" said the demon.

49
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,660
He swung his sword.@g]

50
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:14,732
Wukong jumped out of the way and then flew at the demon.

51
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:19,412
[i@Pow!@i] Wukong hit the demon on the nose.

52
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:22,177
"Argh!" cried the demon.

53
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:26,570
Wukong pulled out a handful of his own hair and blew on it.

54
00:03:26,571 --> 00:03:34,774
[i@Poof!@i] Each strand of hair turned into a fake monkeyâ€”exactly like Wukong.

55
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:40,162
All at once the fake monkeys attacked the demon, punching and kicking him.

56
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:42,492
[g@"What . . . What's going on?"

57
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:47,054
cried the demon, [n@trying to fight all the fake monkeys.@g]

58
00:03:47,055 --> 00:03:50,236
[g@"It's a magic spell," said Wukong.

59
00:03:50,237 --> 00:03:53,030
"It's called Body Beyond the Body."@g]

60
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:58,660
The Demon of Chaos was soon destroyed.

61
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:05,237
Wukong chased away the guards and then went into the cave.

62
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:09,082
He found all the monkeys and apes that the demon had kidnapped.

63
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:13,044
When they saw him, they cheered.

64
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:16,961
[g@"Your Majesty!" cried the monkeys and apes.

65
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:19,425
"You came back!"@g]

66
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:26,554
Wukong smiled. "I will take you home!"

67
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:31,179
The next morning Wukong woke up early.

68
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,624
"Other demons might attack us," he thought.

69
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:39,306
"We must be ready to protect ourselves."

70
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:43,877
Wukong spent the day teaching his subjects how to fight.

71
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:47,306
They practiced with swords and spears.

72
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:52,316
Before long, the monkeys and apes were a fierce army.

73
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:56,298
"No demon will dare bother us now," said the gibbon.

74
00:04:56,299 --> 00:05:01,222
"No," said Wukong. "There's just one problem though."

75
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:05,300
"What's that?" asked the gibbon.

76
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:11,746
"I can't use any of the weapons we have!" said Wukong.
