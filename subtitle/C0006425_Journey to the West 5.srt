1
00:00:11,267 --> 177:16:51,267
"What happened here?" Wukong asked the gibbon.

2
177:18:31,267 --> 304:36:51,267
A few more monkeys and apes gathered around Sun Wukong and the gibbon.

3
304:38:31,267 --> 358:55:11,267
They looked scared.

4
358:56:51,267 --> 438:35:11,267
"A demon attacked us," said the gibbon.

5
438:36:51,267 --> 531:16:51,267
"We tried to fight him, but he was too powerful.

6
531:18:31,267 --> 636:00:11,267
He stole most of our things and kidnapped many of us."

7
636:01:51,267 --> 700:38:31,267
[g@Wukong was furious.

8
700:40:11,267 --> 772:20:11,267
"Who is he? Where does he live?"@g]

9
772:21:51,267 --> 870:01:51,267
"He is called the Demon of Chaos," said the gibbon.

10
870:03:31,267 --> 950:33:31,267
"He came from the north."

11
950:35:11,267 --> 1084:35:11,267
"Wait here," Wukong ordered. "I will handle the demon."

12
1084:36:51,267 --> 1176:41:51,267
"The demon is very powerful," the gibbon warned.

13
1176:43:31,267 --> 1290:21:51,267
"I learned many things from a sage," Wukong replied.

14
1290:23:31,267 --> 1371:51:51,267
[g@"I am now as powerful as a god!

15
1371:53:31,267 --> 1442:01:51,267
I'm not afraid of any demon.@g]

16
1442:03:31,267 --> 1509:25:11,267
I'll be back soon."

17
1509:26:51,267 --> 1647:45:11,267
He leaped into the air and flew north.

18
1647:46:51,267 --> 1724:10:11,267
His subjects stared in amazement.

19
1724:11:51,267 --> 1840:31:51,267
"Our king can fly!" said the gibbon.

20
1840:33:31,267 --> 1937:00:11,267
[g@Wukong soon spotted a gloomy mountain.

21
1937:01:51,267 --> 2023:30:11,267
Dark clouds hung over it.@g]

22
2023:31:51,267 --> 2165:00:11,267
"That looks like a demon's home," he thought.

23
2165:01:51,267 --> 2265:30:11,267
Wukong landed on the mountain and found a cave.

24
2265:31:51,267 --> 2402:51:51,267
Two guards stood at the entrance, practicing sword fighting.

25
2402:53:31,267 --> 2523:05:11,267
"I'm king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain!" yelled Wukong.

26
2523:06:51,267 --> 2604:50:11,267
[g@"The Demon of Chaos attacked my subjects!

27
2604:51:51,267 --> 2732:25:11,267
I want revenge!"@g]

28
2732:26:51,267 --> 2881:25:11,267
"Ahh!" the guards shrieked, and ran into the cave.

29
2881:26:51,267 --> 2993:13:31,267
The Demon of Chaos was sitting at a table, eating a meal.

30
2993:15:11,267 --> 3073:36:51,267
"Disaster!" one guard cried.

31
3073:38:31,267 --> 3191:50:11,267
"What sort of disaster?" asked the demon.

32
3191:51:51,267 --> 3296:56:51,267
"There's a monkey outside," said the other guard.

33
3296:58:31,267 --> 3384:46:51,267
"He said he's king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

34
3384:48:31,267 --> 3451:01:51,267
[g@You attacked his subjects.

35
3451:03:31,267 --> 3540:31:51,267
Now he wants revenge!"@g]

36
3540:33:31,267 --> 3667:25:11,267
"The monkeys and apes have spoken of a king," said the demon.

37
3667:26:51,267 --> 3726:25:11,267
[g@"He left to find a sage.

38
3726:26:51,267 --> 3796:10:11,267
I guess he returned."@g]

39
3796:11:51,267 --> 3847:23:31,267
[g@The demon stood up.

40
3847:25:11,267 --> 3942:15:11,267
"Does the monkey have any weapons?"@g]

41
3942:16:51,267 --> 4023:31:51,267
"No," said one guard.

42
4023:33:31,267 --> 4160:46:51,267
"Then get me my armor and my sword," said the demon.

43
4160:48:31,267 --> 4374:21:51,267
A moment later the Demon of Chaos walked outside.

44
4374:23:31,267 --> 4448:26:51,267
[g@He looked at Wukong and laughed.

45
4448:28:31,267 --> 4544:33:31,267
"You're just a little monkey!" he said.@g]

46
4544:35:11,267 --> 4632:28:31,267
Wukong looked up at the huge demon.

47
4632:30:11,267 --> 4824:23:31,267
"I am small," he said, "but I am more powerful than you can imagine."

48
4824:25:11,267 --> 4920:46:51,267
[g@"I'm not afraid of you!" said the demon.

49
4920:48:31,267 --> 4983:08:31,267
He swung his sword.@g]

50
4983:10:11,267 --> 5096:15:11,267
Wukong jumped out of the way and then flew at the demon.

51
5096:16:51,267 --> 5226:15:11,267
[i@Pow!@i] Wukong hit the demon on the nose.

52
5226:16:51,267 --> 5303:03:31,267
"Argh!" cried the demon.

53
5303:05:11,267 --> 5425:05:11,267
Wukong pulled out a handful of his own hair and blew on it.

54
5425:06:51,267 --> 5652:58:31,267
[i@Poof!@i] Each strand of hair turned into a fake monkeyâ€”exactly like Wukong.

55
5653:00:11,267 --> 5802:38:31,267
All at once the fake monkeys attacked the demon, punching and kicking him.

56
5802:40:11,267 --> 5867:21:51,267
[g@"What . . . What's going on?"

57
5867:23:31,267 --> 5994:05:11,267
cried the demon, [n@trying to fight all the fake monkeys.@g]

58
5994:06:51,267 --> 6082:28:31,267
[g@"It's a magic spell," said Wukong.

59
6082:30:11,267 --> 6160:05:11,267
"It's called Body Beyond the Body."@g]

60
6160:06:51,267 --> 6316:28:31,267
The Demon of Chaos was soon destroyed.

61
6316:30:11,267 --> 6499:10:11,267
Wukong chased away the guards and then went into the cave.

62
6499:11:51,267 --> 6605:58:31,267
He found all the monkeys and apes that the demon had kidnapped.

63
6606:00:11,267 --> 6716:01:51,267
When they saw him, they cheered.

64
6716:03:31,267 --> 6824:50:11,267
[g@"Your Majesty!" cried the monkeys and apes.

65
6824:51:51,267 --> 6893:16:51,267
"You came back!"@g]

66
6893:18:31,267 --> 7091:18:31,267
Wukong smiled. "I will take you home!"

67
7091:20:11,267 --> 7219:46:51,267
The next morning Wukong woke up early.

68
7219:48:31,267 --> 7315:28:31,267
"Other demons might attack us," he thought.

69
7315:30:11,267 --> 7445:31:51,267
"We must be ready to protect ourselves."

70
7445:33:31,267 --> 7572:30:11,267
Wukong spent the day teaching his subjects how to fight.

71
7572:31:51,267 --> 7667:45:11,267
They practiced with swords and spears.

72
7667:46:51,267 --> 7806:55:11,267
Before long, the monkeys and apes were a fierce army.

73
7806:56:51,267 --> 7917:31:51,267
"No demon will dare bother us now," said the gibbon.

74
7917:33:31,267 --> 8054:18:31,267
"No," said Wukong. "There's just one problem though."

75
8054:20:11,267 --> 8167:35:11,267
"What's that?" asked the gibbon.

76
8167:36:51,267 --> 8346:38:31,267
"I can't use any of the weapons we have!" said Wukong.
