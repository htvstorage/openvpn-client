1
00:00:11,000 --> 153:23:31,000
Wukong and Guanyin stood on the lotus platform above Red Boy's mountain.

2
153:25:11,000 --> 249:31:51,000
"Let's attack Red Boy now," said the monkey.

3
249:33:31,000 --> 367:36:51,000
"Wait, Wukong," said Guanyin, holding up a hand.

4
367:38:31,000 --> 487:55:11,000
"There's a lot of water in this vaseâ€”enough for an ocean.

5
487:56:51,000 --> 595:01:51,000
I don't want any animals harmed when I pour it out."

6
595:03:31,000 --> 672:16:51,000
She recited a quick spell.

7
672:18:31,000 --> 813:45:11,000
A moment later the local spirit arrived.

8
813:46:51,000 --> 955:15:11,000
"Bodhisattva," said the spirit. "What can I do for you?"

9
955:16:51,000 --> 1101:11:51,000
"I'm going to pour magic water around Red Boy's mountain," said Guanyin.

10
1101:13:31,000 --> 1242:51:51,000
"Please make sure all the animals are far, far away from the mountain."

11
1242:53:31,000 --> 1338:25:11,000
"Yes, Bodhisattva," said the spirit.

12
1338:26:51,000 --> 1429:35:11,000
[g@The spirit flew down to earth.

13
1429:36:51,000 --> 1515:01:51,000
Wukong watched the ground below.@g]

14
1515:03:31,000 --> 1647:05:11,000
First he saw some small animals scurry out from under bushes.

15
1647:06:51,000 --> 1752:45:11,000
Birds flew from branches.

16
1752:46:51,000 --> 1904:15:11,000
Then tigers, bears, and other large animals stampeded down the mountainside.

17
1904:16:51,000 --> 2050:00:11,000
Soon there wasn't a single animal anywhere near the mountain.

18
2050:01:51,000 --> 2153:53:31,000
"Now I can pour the water out," said Guanyin.

19
2153:55:11,000 --> 2290:25:11,000
She tipped the vase, and rolling waves of water poured out.

20
2290:26:51,000 --> 2388:18:31,000
The waves washed down the slopes of the mountain.

21
2388:20:11,000 --> 2518:05:11,000
The water level rose higher and higher, forming an ocean.

22
2518:06:51,000 --> 2633:16:51,000
Only the top of the mountain was above water.

23
2633:18:31,000 --> 2774:11:51,000
"Wukong, go down there and get the demon to come out," said Guanyin.

24
2774:13:31,000 --> 2851:48:31,000
[g@"Fight him, but don't defeat him.

25
2851:50:11,000 --> 2954:10:11,000
Instead, lead him up here to me."@g]

26
2954:11:51,000 --> 3064:45:11,000
Wukong jumped down to the mountain.

27
3064:46:51,000 --> 3161:45:11,000
He pulled out his iron bar and swung it.

28
3161:46:51,000 --> 3285:06:51,000
[i@Smash!@i] The door to the cave exploded.

29
3285:08:31,000 --> 3401:05:11,000
Red Boy ran out of the cave, looking furious.

30
3401:06:51,000 --> 3518:00:11,000
"You smashed my front door!" he shouted.

31
3518:01:51,000 --> 3581:56:51,000
"That's right," said the monkey.

32
3581:58:31,000 --> 3686:26:51,000
"And I'll smash [i@you@i] if you don't release my friends."

33
3686:28:31,000 --> 3910:35:11,000
"Ha!" Red Boy laughed and then punched himself [n@in the nose. Nothing happened.

34
3910:36:51,000 --> 4009:46:51,000
"Why didn't my fire magic work?" asked the demon.

35
4009:48:31,000 --> 4141:58:31,000
Then he noticed the ocean surrounding his mountain.

36
4142:00:11,000 --> 4342:56:51,000
Wukong laughed. "That is magic water, brought [n@here by the bodhisattva Guanyin.

37
4342:58:31,000 --> 4441:16:51,000
You can't make fire anywhere near it."

38
4441:18:31,000 --> 4578:41:51,000
"Aargh!" Red Boy stabbed at Wukong with his lance.

39
4578:43:31,000 --> 4740:53:31,000
[i@Clang!@i] The monkey blocked the lance with his iron bar.

40
4740:55:11,000 --> 4833:50:11,000
Red Boy grunted and stabbed again.

41
4833:51:51,000 --> 4987:40:11,000
Wukong swung his iron bar, nearly knocking the lance from Red Boy's hands.

42
4987:41:51,000 --> 5135:13:31,000
The two fought until Wukong, pretending to be scared, leaped into the air.

43
5135:15:11,000 --> 5178:20:11,000
[g@Red Boy followed.

44
5178:21:51,000 --> 5258:58:31,000
Up into the sky they flew.@g]

45
5259:00:11,000 --> 5348:45:11,000
Red Boy kept jabbing his lance at Wukong.

46
5348:46:51,000 --> 5433:00:11,000
The monkey blocked it with his iron bar.

47
5433:01:51,000 --> 5537:53:31,000
Wukong hurried toward Guanyin on the lotus platform.

48
5537:55:11,000 --> 5626:31:51,000
He flew fast and ducked behind her.

49
5626:33:31,000 --> 5740:08:31,000
When Red Boy saw the bodhisattva, he stopped.

50
5740:10:11,000 --> 5845:33:31,000
"What are you doing here, Bodhisattva?" he demanded.

51
5845:35:11,000 --> 5912:01:51,000
[g@Guanyin stared back at the demon.

52
5912:03:31,000 --> 5984:16:51,000
But she didn't say a word.@g]

53
5984:18:31,000 --> 6102:31:51,000
"I asked why you're here!" shouted Red Boy.

54
6102:33:31,000 --> 6195:48:31,000
Again Guanyin didn't answer.

55
6195:50:11,000 --> 6299:40:11,000
"Did Wukong ask you to come here?" shouted the demon.

56
6299:41:51,000 --> 6345:20:11,000
"Why don't you speak?"

57
6345:21:51,000 --> 6460:30:11,000
[g@Guanyin continued to stare silently at Red Boy.

58
6460:31:51,000 --> 6554:51:51,000
The demon became furious.@g]

59
6554:53:31,000 --> 6660:01:51,000
[g@He raised his lance and shot toward Guanyin.

60
6660:03:31,000 --> 6734:15:11,000
The bodhisattva vanished!@g]

61
6734:16:51,000 --> 6895:10:11,000
Red Boy laughed. "I guess she was scared of me."

62
6895:11:51,000 --> 6988:28:31,000
[g@He looked at the empty lotus platform.

63
6988:30:11,000 --> 7047:56:51,000
"Wukong is a fool!@g]

64
7047:58:31,000 --> 7163:51:51,000
He couldn't defeat my fire magic, so he asked Guanyin for help.

65
7163:53:31,000 --> 7209:26:51,000
[g@And what did she do?

66
7209:28:31,000 --> 7307:28:31,000
She ran away as soon as I raised my weapon.@g]

67
7307:30:11,000 --> 7438:11:51,000
Now this Buddhist treasure is mine!"

68
7438:13:31,000 --> 7519:56:51,000
Red Boy sat down on the platform.

69
7519:58:31,000 --> 7665:48:31,000
Instantly the platform turned back into swords, which surrounded the demon.

70
7665:50:11,000 --> 7777:26:51,000
Sharp points stuck at him on all sides.

71
7777:28:31,000 --> 7996:53:31,000
"Oh no!" cried Red Boy. "I'm trapped!"
