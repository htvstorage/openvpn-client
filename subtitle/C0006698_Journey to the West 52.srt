00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,522
Wukong and Guanyin stood on the lotus platform above Red Boy's mountain.

2
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:19,983
"Let's attack Red Boy now," said the monkey.

3
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:24,234
"Wait, Wukong," said Guanyin, holding up a hand.

4
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:28,565
"There's a lot of water in this vaseâ€”enough for an ocean.

5
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:32,421
I don't want any animals harmed when I pour it out."

6
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:35,202
She recited a quick spell.

7
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:40,295
A moment later the local spirit arrived.

8
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:45,389
"Bodhisattva," said the spirit. "What can I do for you?"

9
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,643
"I'm going to pour magic water around Red Boy's mountain," said Guanyin.

10
00:00:50,644 --> 00:00:55,743
"Please make sure all the animals are far, far away from the mountain."

11
00:00:55,744 --> 00:00:59,183
"Yes, Bodhisattva," said the spirit.

12
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,465
[g@The spirit flew down to earth.

13
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:05,541
Wukong watched the ground below.@g]

14
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:10,295
First he saw some small animals scurry out from under bushes.

15
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:14,099
Birds flew from branches.

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,553
Then tigers, bears, and other large animals stampeded down the mountainside.

17
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:24,800
Soon there wasn't a single animal anywhere near the mountain.

18
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:28,540
"Now I can pour the water out," said Guanyin.

19
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:33,455
She tipped the vase, and rolling waves of water poured out.

20
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:36,979
The waves washed down the slopes of the mountain.

21
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,651
The water level rose higher and higher, forming an ocean.

22
00:01:41,652 --> 00:01:45,798
Only the top of the mountain was above water.

23
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,871
"Wukong, go down there and get the demon to come out," said Guanyin.

24
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:53,665
[g@"Fight him, but don't defeat him.

25
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:57,350
Instead, lead him up here to me."@g]

26
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:01,331
Wukong jumped down to the mountain.

27
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:04,823
He pulled out his iron bar and swung it.

28
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:09,264
[i@Smash!@i] The door to the cave exploded.

29
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:13,439
Red Boy ran out of the cave, looking furious.

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,648
"You smashed my front door!" he shouted.

31
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:19,950
"That's right," said the monkey.

32
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:23,712
"And I'll smash [i@you@i] if you don't release my friends."

33
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:31,781
"Ha!" Red Boy laughed and then punched himself [n@in the nose. Nothing happened.

34
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:35,352
"Why didn't my fire magic work?" asked the demon.

35
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:40,111
Then he noticed the ocean surrounding his mountain.

36
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:47,346
Wukong laughed. "That is magic water, brought [n@here by the bodhisattva Guanyin.

37
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:50,886
You can't make fire anywhere near it."

38
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:55,833
"Aargh!" Red Boy stabbed at Wukong with his lance.

39
00:02:55,834 --> 00:03:01,672
[i@Clang!@i] The monkey blocked the lance with his iron bar.

40
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:05,018
Red Boy grunted and stabbed again.

41
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:10,556
Wukong swung his iron bar, nearly knocking the lance from Red Boy's hands.

42
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:15,868
The two fought until Wukong, pretending to be scared, leaped into the air.

43
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:17,420
[g@Red Boy followed.

44
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:20,323
Up into the sky they flew.@g]

45
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:23,555
Red Boy kept jabbing his lance at Wukong.

46
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:26,588
The monkey blocked it with his iron bar.

47
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:30,364
Wukong hurried toward Guanyin on the lotus platform.

48
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:33,555
He flew fast and ducked behind her.

49
00:03:33,556 --> 00:03:37,645
When Red Boy saw the bodhisattva, he stopped.

50
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:41,440
"What are you doing here, Bodhisattva?" he demanded.

51
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,833
[g@Guanyin stared back at the demon.

52
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:46,434
But she didn't say a word.@g]

53
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:50,691
"I asked why you're here!" shouted Red Boy.

54
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:54,049
Again Guanyin didn't answer.

55
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,788
"Did Wukong ask you to come here?" shouted the demon.

56
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:59,432
"Why don't you speak?"

57
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:03,578
[g@Guanyin continued to stare silently at Red Boy.

58
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:06,975
The demon became furious.@g]

59
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:10,761
[g@He raised his lance and shot toward Guanyin.

60
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:13,433
The bodhisattva vanished!@g]

61
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:19,226
Red Boy laughed. "I guess she was scared of me."

62
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:22,585
[g@He looked at the empty lotus platform.

63
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:24,726
"Wukong is a fool!@g]

64
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:28,899
He couldn't defeat my fire magic, so he asked Guanyin for help.

65
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,540
[g@And what did she do?

66
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:34,069
She ran away as soon as I raised my weapon.@g]

67
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,775
Now this Buddhist treasure is mine!"

68
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:41,718
Red Boy sat down on the platform.

69
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:46,969
Instantly the platform turned back into swords, which surrounded the demon.

70
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,988
Sharp points stuck at him on all sides.

71
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:58,888
"Oh no!" cried Red Boy. "I'm trapped!"
