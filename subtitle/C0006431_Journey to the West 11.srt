1
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:25,057
Erlang quickly tied up Wukong and brought him up to Heaven.

2
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:31,348
"I want Sun Wukong destroyed," said the Jade Emperor.

3
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,897
Soldiers tied Wukong to a pillar in a courtyard.

4
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:40,293
They struck him with swords.

5
00:00:40,294 --> 00:00:43,588
But his body was as hard as a diamond.

6
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:45,814
The swords shattered.

7
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:50,753
Wukong laughed. "Your swords can't hurt me!"

8
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:53,664
The Jade Emperor turned to a messenger.

9
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:58,526
"Bring in the fire gods."

10
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:04,149
Several fire gods entered the courtyard and threw balls of flame at Wukong.

11
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,238
The courtyard filled with smoke.

12
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:14,489
But when the smoke cleared, not one hair on Wukong's body was burned.

13
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:21,436
"Thank you!" Wukong laughed. "I was feeling a little cold!"

14
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:26,542
"Gather the thunder gods," said the Jade Emperor.

15
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:30,719
Several thunder gods entered the courtyard.

16
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,587
The Jade Emperor smiled as lightning bolts shot toward Wukong.

17
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:39,167
But even the lightning couldn't harm the monkey.

18
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:42,784
"That tickled!" said Wukong with a smile.

19
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:46,623
The Jade Emperor shook his head.

20
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:50,308
"It seems that Wukong can't be destroyed."

21
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:54,264
"That's because he ate all the peaches," said Laozi.

22
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:57,911
"Just one peach would make someone live forever.

23
00:01:57,912 --> 00:02:01,157
He ate every peach in the garden!"

24
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:02,731
The emperor frowned.

25
00:02:02,732 --> 00:02:05,506
"Then how will we get rid of him?"

26
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:08,379
"I have an idea," said Laozi.

27
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,103
"I'll put him in the large pot I use for making potions.

28
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:14,989
Maybe we can burn him up slowly."

29
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:20,767
"Perfect," said the Jade Emperor.

30
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:28,242
Soldiers brought Wukong to a room in Laozi's palace.

31
00:02:28,243 --> 00:02:32,016
A large pot sat in the middle of the room.

32
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:40,573
Laozi put Wukong into the pot and then closed the lid.

33
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:44,716
Laozi started a fire under the pot.

34
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:47,917
Day and night he tended the fire.

35
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:52,465
He kept it burning for 49 days.

36
00:02:52,466 --> 00:03:02,299
"Wukong must have been destroyed by now," thought Laozi.

37
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,203
He slowly took the lid off the pot.

38
00:03:06,204 --> 00:03:13,052
Smoke poured from the opening, and Wukong leaped out!

39
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:15,040
The pot fell over.

40
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:20,407
Burning pieces of coal flew everywhere.

41
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,984
Wukong's eyes were red, and he was coughing.

42
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:29,075
"That smoke was horrible!" he cried.

43
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:33,310
He pushed Laozi, knocking the sage onto his back.

44
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:38,813
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and smashed everything in the room.

45
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:42,064
"Somebody, stop him!" cried Laozi.

46
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:46,185
Wukong ran out of Laozi's palace.

47
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:51,411
Gods and spirits fled as Wukong smashed everything in his path.

48
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:56,566
Laozi ran into the Cloud Palace.

49
00:03:56,567 --> 00:04:01,588
"Your Majesty, Wukong is causing trouble all over Heaven!" he said.

50
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:05,832
"What!" cried the emperor. "He's alive?"

51
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,976
"Yes," said Laozi.

52
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:11,531
"I took the lid off the pot because I thought he was burned up.

53
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:14,115
But the fire didn't hurt him at all."

54
00:04:14,116 --> 00:04:17,629
"This is an outrage!" said the Jade Emperor.

55
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,715
"What are we going to do with that monkey?"

56
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:23,895
The emperor thought for a moment.

57
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:27,203
"We must ask Buddha for help," he said.

58
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:29,343
He turned to a messenger.

59
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:31,924
"Go to the Western Paradise quickly.

60
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:37,580
See if Buddha can come to help us."

61
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:45,062
Flying as fast as he could, the messenger headed toward the Western Paradise.

62
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:52,000
Everybody hid indoors as Wukong ran through Heaven.

63
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:57,582
Using his iron bar, he smashed doors and windows and knocked over statues.

64
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,971
Suddenly he stopped.

65
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:06,360
Before him was a huge figure, glowing with golden light.

66
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:09,617
"What do you want?" asked Wukong.

67
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:13,217
"I am Buddha," said the figure.

68
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:18,695
"Who are you, and why are you causing all this trouble?"

69
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:25,516
Wukong smiled. "I am Sun Wukong, king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

70
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:28,656
I should be the king of Heaven too!

71
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:33,206
I'm going to the Cloud Palace to tell the Jade Emperor to leave.

72
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:43,758
If he doesn't, I'll never stop causing trouble!"
