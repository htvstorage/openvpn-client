00:00:11,050.66700000000128 --> 389:03:31,050.66700005531311
Erlang quickly tied up Wukong and brought him up to Heaven.

2
389:05:11,050.66700005531311 --> 563:48:31,050.66700005531311
"I want Sun Wukong destroyed," said the Jade Emperor.

3
563:50:11,050.66700005531311 --> 690:10:11,050.66699981689453
Soldiers tied Wukong to a pillar in a courtyard.

4
690:11:51,050.66699981689453 --> 812:16:51,050.66699981689453
[g@They struck him with swords.

5
812:18:31,050.66699981689453 --> 903:48:31,050.66699981689453
But his body was as hard as a diamond.@g]

6
903:50:11,050.66699981689453 --> 965:38:31,050.66699981689453
The swords shattered.

7
965:40:11,050.66699981689453 --> 1102:50:11,050.66699981689453
Wukong laughed. "Your swords can't hurt me!"

8
1102:51:51,050.66699981689453 --> 1183:41:51,050.66699981689453
[g@The Jade Emperor turned to a messenger.

9
1183:43:31,050.66699981689453 --> 1318:45:11,050.66699981689453
"Bring in the fire gods."@g]

10
1318:46:51,050.66699981689453 --> 1474:56:51,050.66699981689453
Several fire gods entered the courtyard and threw balls of flame at Wukong.

11
1474:58:31,050.66699981689453 --> 1588:31:51,050.66699981689453
The courtyard filled with smoke.

12
1588:33:31,050.66699981689453 --> 1762:10:11,050.66699981689453
But when the smoke cleared, not one hair on Wukong's body was burned.

13
1762:11:51,050.66699981689453 --> 1955:08:31,050.66699981689453
"Thank you!" Wukong laughed. "I was feeling a little cold!"

14
1955:10:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2096:58:31,050.66699981689453
"Gather the thunder gods," said the Jade Emperor.

15
2097:00:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2213:00:11,050.66699981689453
Several thunder gods entered the courtyard.

16
2213:01:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2348:13:31,050.66699981689453
The Jade Emperor smiled as lightning bolts shot toward Wukong.

17
2348:15:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2447:40:11,050.66699981689453
But even the lightning couldn't harm the monkey.

18
2447:41:51,050.66699981689453 --> 2548:08:31,050.66699981689453
"That tickled!" said Wukong with a smile.

19
2548:10:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2654:46:51,050.66699981689453
[g@The Jade Emperor shook his head.

20
2654:48:31,050.66699981689453 --> 2757:08:31,050.66699981689453
"It seems that Wukong can't be destroyed."@g]

21
2757:10:11,050.66699981689453 --> 2867:01:51,050.66699981689453
"That's because he ate all the peaches," said Laozi.

22
2867:03:31,050.66699981689453 --> 2968:20:11,050.66699981689453
"Just one peach would make someone live forever.

23
2968:21:51,050.66699981689453 --> 3058:30:11,050.66699981689453
He ate every peach in the garden!"

24
3058:31:51,050.66699981689453 --> 3102:13:31,050.66699981689453
[g@The emperor frowned.

25
3102:15:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3179:18:31,050.66699981689453
"Then how will we get rid of him?"@g]

26
3179:20:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3259:06:51,050.66699981689453
"I have an idea," said Laozi.

27
3259:08:31,050.66699981689453 --> 3362:33:31,050.66699981689453
"I'll put him in the large pot I use for making potions.

28
3362:35:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3442:43:31,050.66699981689453
Maybe we can burn him up slowly."

29
3442:45:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3603:13:31,050.66699981689453
"Perfect," said the Jade Emperor.

30
3603:15:11,050.66699981689453 --> 3810:51:51,050.66699981689453
Soldiers brought Wukong to a room in Laozi's palace.

31
3810:53:31,050.66699981689453 --> 3915:41:51,050.66699981689453
A large pot sat in the middle of the room.

32
3915:43:31,050.66699981689453 --> 4153:23:31,050.66699981689453
Laozi put Wukong into the pot and then closed the lid.

33
4153:25:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4268:28:31,050.66699981689453
[g@Laozi started a fire under the pot.

34
4268:30:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4357:23:31,050.66699981689453
Day and night he tended the fire.@g]

35
4357:25:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4483:43:31,050.66699981689453
He kept it burning for 49 days.

36
4483:45:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4756:53:31,050.66699981689453
"Wukong must have been destroyed by now," thought Laozi.

37
4756:55:11,050.66699981689453 --> 4865:20:11,050.66699981689453
He slowly took the lid off the pot.

38
4865:21:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5055:35:11,050.66699981689453
[g@Smoke poured from the opening, and Wukong leaped out!

39
5055:36:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5110:48:31,050.66699981689453
The pot fell over.@g]

40
5110:50:11,050.66699981689453 --> 5259:53:31,050.66699981689453
Burning pieces of coal flew everywhere.

41
5259:55:11,050.66699981689453 --> 5359:15:11,050.66699981689453
Wukong's eyes were red, and he was coughing.

42
5359:16:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5500:40:11,050.66699981689453
"That smoke was horrible!" he cried.

43
5500:41:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5618:18:31,050.66699981689453
He pushed Laozi, knocking the sage onto his back.

44
5618:20:11,050.66699981689453 --> 5771:10:11,050.66699981689453
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and smashed everything in the room.

45
5771:11:51,050.66699981689453 --> 5861:28:31,050.66699981689453
"Somebody, stop him!" cried Laozi.

46
5861:30:11,050.66699981689453 --> 5975:56:51,050.66699981689453
Wukong ran out of Laozi's palace.

47
5975:58:31,050.66699981689453 --> 6121:06:51,050.66699981689453
Gods and spirits fled as Wukong smashed everything in his path.

48
6121:08:31,050.66699981689453 --> 6264:18:31,050.66699981689453
Laozi ran into the Cloud Palace.

49
6264:20:11,050.66699981689453 --> 6403:48:31,050.66699981689453
"Your Majesty, Wukong is causing trouble all over Heaven!" he said.

50
6403:50:11,050.66699981689453 --> 6521:41:51,050.66699981689453
"What!" cried the emperor. "He's alive?"

51
6521:43:31,050.66699981689453 --> 6581:15:11,050.66699981689453
"Yes," said Laozi.

52
6581:16:51,050.66699981689453 --> 6680:00:11,050.66699981689453
"I took the lid off the pot because I thought he was burned up.

53
6680:01:51,050.66699981689453 --> 6751:46:51,050.66699981689453
But the fire didn't hurt him at all."

54
6751:48:31,050.66699981689453 --> 6849:23:31,050.66699981689453
"This is an outrage!" said the Jade Emperor.

55
6849:25:11,050.66699981689453 --> 6935:06:51,050.66699981689453
"What are we going to do with that monkey?"

56
6935:08:31,050.66699981689453 --> 7023:26:51,050.66699981689453
The emperor thought for a moment.

57
7023:28:31,050.66699981689453 --> 7115:20:11,050.66699981689453
[g@"We must ask Buddha for help," he said.

58
7115:21:51,050.66699981689453 --> 7174:46:51,050.66699981689453
He turned to a messenger.@g]

59
7174:48:31,050.66699981689453 --> 7246:28:31,050.66699981689453
[g@"Go to the Western Paradise quickly.

60
7246:30:11,050.66699981689453 --> 7403:35:11,050.66699981689453
See if Buddha can come to help us."@g]

61
7403:36:51,050.66699981689453 --> 7611:25:11,050.66699981689453
Flying as fast as he could, the messenger [n@headed toward the Western Paradise.

62
7611:26:51,050.66699981689453 --> 7804:08:31,050.66699981689453
Everybody hid indoors as Wukong ran through Heaven.

63
7804:10:11,050.66699981689453 --> 7959:11:51,050.66699981689453
Using his iron bar, he smashed doors and windows and knocked over statues.

64
7959:13:31,050.66699981689453 --> 8053:20:11,050.66699981689453
Suddenly he stopped.

65
8053:21:51,050.66699981689453 --> 8203:01:51,050.66699981689453
Before him was a huge figure, glowing with golden light.

66
8203:03:31,050.66699981689453 --> 8293:30:11,050.66699981689453
"What do you want?" asked Wukong.

67
8293:31:51,050.66699981689453 --> 8393:30:11,050.66699981689453
"I am Buddha," said the figure.

68
8393:31:51,050.66699981689453 --> 8545:40:11,050.66699981689453
"Who are you, and why are you causing all this trouble?"

69
8545:41:51,050.66699981689453 --> 8735:08:31,050.66699981689453
Wukong smiled. "I am Sun Wukong, king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

70
8735:10:11,050.66699981689453 --> 8822:21:51,050.66699981689453
I should be the king of Heaven too!

71
8822:23:31,050.66699981689453 --> 8948:45:11,050.66699981689453
I'm going to the Cloud Palace to tell the Jade Emperor to leave.

72
8948:46:51,050.66699981689453 --> 9241:51:51,050.66699981689453
If he doesn't, I'll never stop causing trouble!"
