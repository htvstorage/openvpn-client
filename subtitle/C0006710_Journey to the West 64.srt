00:00:11,000 --> 205:23:31,000
"I hope that monkey finds a lot of food," said Bajie. "I'm hungry."

2
205:25:11,000 --> 281:48:31,000
[g@The Tang Monk shivered and hugged himself.

3
281:50:11,000 --> 356:08:31,000
"I'm so cold," he said.@g]

4
356:10:11,000 --> 483:11:51,000
He looked up at the monastery again and then back at his companions.

5
483:13:31,000 --> 592:26:51,000
"Do you two believe there are demons up there?"

6
592:28:31,000 --> 662:18:31,000
Wujing stroked his chin.

7
662:20:11,000 --> 710:00:11,000
[g@"I'm not sure.

8
710:01:51,000 --> 792:11:51,000
Wukong believed it though."@g]

9
792:13:31,000 --> 901:43:31,000
Bajie snorted. "Wukong is too careful.

10
901:45:11,000 --> 984:43:31,000
He's always worried that we'll bump into a demon."

11
984:45:11,000 --> 1165:10:11,000
His stomach grumbled. "I'm starving."

12
1165:11:51,000 --> 1265:06:51,000
Wujing looked at the monastery again.

13
1265:08:31,000 --> 1373:05:11,000
"That place looks perfectly safe to me."

14
1373:06:51,000 --> 1467:20:11,000
[g@Bajie nodded. "It looks warm too.

15
1467:21:51,000 --> 1534:15:11,000
Maybe the monks there will take us in."@g]

16
1534:16:51,000 --> 1668:08:31,000
"It would be nice to get out of this cold," said the Tang Monk.

17
1668:10:11,000 --> 1735:15:11,000
[g@"That settles it," said the pig.

18
1735:16:51,000 --> 1805:50:11,000
"Who cares what that monkey thinks?@g]

19
1805:51:51,000 --> 1864:45:11,000
[g@What does he know?

20
1864:46:51,000 --> 2047:18:31,000
Let's go up there, get warm, and eat some food."@g]

21
2047:20:11,000 --> 2280:05:11,000
The Tang Monk climbed back onto the horse, and the three [n@travelers headed toward the monastery.

22
2280:06:51,000 --> 2385:28:31,000
When they got there, no people were around.

23
2385:30:11,000 --> 2484:03:31,000
"This place is deserted," said Wujing.

24
2484:05:11,000 --> 2626:03:31,000
Bajie knocked on the door, but no one answered.

25
2626:05:11,000 --> 2787:10:11,000
[g@"Hello!" the pig called. "Is anybody in there?"

26
2787:11:51,000 --> 2860:05:11,000
Again there was no answer.@g]

27
2860:06:51,000 --> 2935:50:11,000
[g@Bajie looked at his companions.

28
2935:51:51,000 --> 3025:08:31,000
"Maybe the monks didn't hear me."@g]

29
3025:10:11,000 --> 3088:43:31,000
[g@His eyes lit up.

30
3088:45:11,000 --> 3179:46:51,000
"Maybe they're all in the kitchen, cooking food!@g]

31
3179:48:31,000 --> 3328:01:51,000
With noodles boiling and vegetables sizzling, a kitchen can be quite noisy."

32
3328:03:31,000 --> 3451:56:51,000
[g@The pig's stomach growled again.

33
3451:58:31,000 --> 3514:53:31,000
"I'll go in and find out."@g]

34
3514:55:11,000 --> 3610:16:51,000
[g@He opened the door and stepped inside.

35
3610:18:31,000 --> 3705:21:51,000
The monastery was dark and silent.@g]

36
3705:23:31,000 --> 3821:36:51,000
"I don't hear anyone cooking," Bajie said to himself.

37
3821:38:31,000 --> 3893:55:11,000
"Maybe there isn't anyone here."

38
3893:56:51,000 --> 4052:16:51,000
He walked down a long hallway, past several dark rooms.

39
4052:18:31,000 --> 4155:13:31,000
"Hello?" he called again.

40
4155:15:11,000 --> 4229:10:11,000
[g@Then he saw a room that was lit up.

41
4229:11:51,000 --> 4283:45:11,000
He went inside.@g]

42
4283:46:51,000 --> 4403:36:51,000
Bright sunlight was streaming through a window and onto a table.

43
4403:38:31,000 --> 4526:13:31,000
On the table were three silk vests.

44
4526:15:11,000 --> 4635:45:11,000
"Those vests look magnificent," said the pig.

45
4635:46:51,000 --> 4722:53:31,000
[g@He shivered. "They also look warm."

46
4722:55:11,000 --> 4807:31:51,000
He looked around.@g]

47
4807:33:31,000 --> 4949:48:31,000
Then he grabbed the vests and hurried back outside.

48
4949:50:11,000 --> 5049:53:31,000
"Nobody's in there," he said to the monk and Wujing.

49
5049:55:11,000 --> 5109:10:11,000
"But I found these vests."

50
5109:11:51,000 --> 5243:46:51,000
"Great!" Wujing grabbed a vest. "I'm freezing."

51
5243:48:31,000 --> 5323:13:31,000
[g@Bajie handed a vest to the Tang Monk.

52
5323:15:11,000 --> 5375:36:51,000
"Here you go, Master."@g]

53
5375:38:31,000 --> 5415:06:51,000
[g@The monk frowned.

54
5415:08:31,000 --> 5450:38:31,000
"I won't wear that.

55
5450:40:11,000 --> 5522:45:11,000
You stole it!"@g]

56
5522:46:51,000 --> 5612:58:31,000
[g@"I didn't steal it," said Bajie.

57
5613:00:11,000 --> 5701:58:31,000
"I . . . borrowed it."@g]

58
5702:00:11,000 --> 5756:18:31,000
[g@The monk glared at him.

59
5756:20:11,000 --> 5836:13:31,000
"You must return those vests right away!"@g]

60
5836:15:11,000 --> 5998:33:31,000
"We can return the vests before we leave," offered Wujing. "Right, Bajie?"

61
5998:35:11,000 --> 6157:08:31,000
"Oh, um, sure," said the pig. "We can do that."

62
6157:10:11,000 --> 6241:58:31,000
"You two are terrible," said the Tang Monk.

63
6242:00:11,000 --> 6366:00:11,000
"We'll never get the True Scriptures from Buddha if you steal."

64
6366:01:51,000 --> 6486:16:51,000
[g@Bajie shrugged. "Master, you don't have to wear your vest.

65
6486:18:31,000 --> 6554:05:11,000
But I'm cold."@g]

66
6554:06:51,000 --> 6640:18:31,000
[g@He put his arm through the armhole.

67
6640:20:11,000 --> 6692:56:51,000
Wujing did the same.@g]

68
6692:58:31,000 --> 6763:33:31,000
[g@Bajie put his other arm through.

69
6763:35:11,000 --> 6886:16:51,000
Wujing began buttoning his vest.@g]

70
6886:18:31,000 --> 6979:28:31,000
Suddenly they both cried out.

71
6979:30:11,000 --> 7053:51:51,000
"It's tight!" cried Bajie.

72
7053:53:31,000 --> 7151:00:11,000
"I can't breathe!" cried Wujing.

73
7151:01:51,000 --> 7281:01:51,000
They both fell to the ground, trying desperately to take the vests off.

74
7281:03:31,000 --> 7367:11:51,000
"This vest won't come off!" cried the pig.

75
7367:13:31,000 --> 7489:58:31,000
"Who stole my vests?" a voice shouted.

76
7490:00:11,000 --> 7622:20:11,000
A demon with one big horn rushed over.

77
7622:21:51,000 --> 7738:08:31,000
He looked at Bajie and Wujing, and then turned to the Tang Monk.

78
7738:10:11,000 --> 7844:41:51,000
"Who are you?" demanded the demon.

79
7844:43:31,000 --> 7990:43:31,000
"I-I'm from the Tang Empire," said the monk, shaking with fear.

80
7990:45:11,000 --> 8085:00:11,000
"I'm traveling to the West forâ€”"

81
8085:01:51,000 --> 8165:40:11,000
[g@The demon clasped his hands together.

82
8165:41:51,000 --> 8364:28:31,000
"You're the Tang Monk!"@g]
