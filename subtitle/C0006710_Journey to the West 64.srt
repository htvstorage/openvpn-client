00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,394
"I hope that monkey finds a lot of food," said Bajie. "I'm hungry."

2
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:21,145
[g@The Tang Monk shivered and hugged himself.

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,821
"I'm so cold," he said.@g]

4
00:00:23,822 --> 00:00:28,395
He looked up at the monastery again and then back at his companions.

5
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:32,328
"Do you two believe there are demons up there?"

6
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,843
Wujing stroked his chin.

7
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:36,560
[g@"I'm not sure.

8
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:39,519
Wukong believed it though."@g]

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,462
Bajie snorted. "Wukong is too careful.

10
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:46,450
He's always worried that we'll bump into a demon."

11
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:52,946
His stomach grumbled. "I'm starving."

12
00:00:52,947 --> 00:00:56,544
Wujing looked at the monastery again.

13
00:00:56,545 --> 00:01:00,431
"That place looks perfectly safe to me."

14
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:03,824
[g@Bajie nodded. "It looks warm too.

15
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:06,233
Maybe the monks there will take us in."@g]

16
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:11,053
"It would be nice to get out of this cold," said the Tang Monk.

17
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:13,469
[g@"That settles it," said the pig.

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,010
"Who cares what that monkey thinks?@g]

19
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:18,131
[g@What does he know?

20
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:24,703
Let's go up there, get warm, and eat some food."@g]

21
00:01:24,704 --> 00:01:33,083
The Tang Monk climbed back onto the horse, and the three [n@travelers headed toward the monastery.

22
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:36,877
When they got there, no people were around.

23
00:01:36,878 --> 00:01:40,426
"This place is deserted," said Wujing.

24
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:45,538
Bajie knocked on the door, but no one answered.

25
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:51,338
[g@"Hello!" the pig called. "Is anybody in there?"

26
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:53,963
Again there was no answer.@g]

27
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:56,690
[g@Bajie looked at his companions.

28
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:59,905
"Maybe the monks didn't hear me."@g]

29
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:02,194
[g@His eyes lit up.

30
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:05,472
"Maybe they're all in the kitchen, cooking food!@g]

31
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:10,809
With noodles boiling and vegetables sizzling, a kitchen can be quite noisy."

32
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,270
[g@The pig's stomach growled again.

33
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,536
"I'll go in and find out."@g]

34
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,970
[g@He opened the door and stepped inside.

35
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:24,393
The monastery was dark and silent.@g]

36
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:28,578
"I don't hear anyone cooking," Bajie said to himself.

37
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:31,181
"Maybe there isn't anyone here."

38
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:36,882
He walked down a long hallway, past several dark rooms.

39
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:40,588
"Hello?" he called again.

40
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:43,250
[g@Then he saw a room that was lit up.

41
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:45,215
He went inside.@g]

42
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:49,530
Bright sunlight was streaming through a window and onto a table.

43
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:53,944
On the table were three silk vests.

44
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:57,887
"Those vests look magnificent," said the pig.

45
00:02:57,888 --> 00:03:01,024
[g@He shivered. "They also look warm."

46
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:04,071
He looked around.@g]

47
00:03:04,072 --> 00:03:09,193
Then he grabbed the vests and hurried back outside.

48
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:12,796
"Nobody's in there," he said to the monk and Wujing.

49
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:14,930
"But I found these vests."

50
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:19,776
"Great!" Wujing grabbed a vest. "I'm freezing."

51
00:03:19,777 --> 00:03:22,636
[g@Bajie handed a vest to the Tang Monk.

52
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,522
"Here you go, Master."@g]

53
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:25,944
[g@The monk frowned.

54
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:27,223
"I won't wear that.

55
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:29,819
You stole it!"@g]

56
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,067
[g@"I didn't steal it," said Bajie.

57
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:36,271
"I . . . borrowed it."@g]

58
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:38,227
[g@The monk glared at him.

59
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:41,104
"You must return those vests right away!"@g]

60
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:46,948
"We can return the vests before we leave," offered Wujing. "Right, Bajie?"

61
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:52,657
"Oh, um, sure," said the pig. "We can do that."

62
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:55,711
"You two are terrible," said the Tang Monk.

63
00:03:55,712 --> 00:04:00,176
"We'll never get the True Scriptures from Buddha if you steal."

64
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:04,506
[g@Bajie shrugged. "Master, you don't have to wear your vest.

65
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:06,947
But I'm cold."@g]

66
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:10,051
[g@He put his arm through the armhole.

67
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:11,946
Wujing did the same.@g]

68
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,488
[g@Bajie put his other arm through.

69
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,906
Wujing began buttoning his vest.@g]

70
00:04:18,907 --> 00:04:22,261
Suddenly they both cried out.

71
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,939
"It's tight!" cried Bajie.

72
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,436
"I can't breathe!" cried Wujing.

73
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:33,117
They both fell to the ground, trying desperately to take the vests off.

74
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:36,219
"This vest won't come off!" cried the pig.

75
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,639
"Who stole my vests?" a voice shouted.

76
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,404
A demon with one big horn rushed over.

77
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:49,573
He looked at Bajie and Wujing, and then turned to the Tang Monk.

78
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:53,409
"Who are you?" demanded the demon.

79
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,666
"I-I'm from the Tang Empire," said the monk, shaking with fear.

80
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:02,060
"I'm traveling to the West for—"

81
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:04,964
[g@The demon clasped his hands together.

82
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:12,121
"You're the Tang Monk!"@g]
