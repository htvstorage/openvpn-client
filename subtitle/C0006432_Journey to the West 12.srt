00:00:10,934 --> 81:00:10,934
[g@Buddha smiled at Wukong.

2
81:01:50,934 --> 184:23:30,934
"How did you get so powerful?"@g]

3
184:25:10,934 --> 378:43:30,934
"A sage taught me secret formulas," said Wukong.

4
378:45:10,934 --> 458:28:30,934
[g@"I practiced them for many years.

5
458:30:10,934 --> 543:16:50,934
I am now equal to the Jade Emperor."@g]

6
543:18:30,934 --> 735:45:10,934
"The Jade Emperor has been practicing the same [n@formulas for many lifetimes," said Buddha.

7
735:46:50,934 --> 828:41:50,934
"How can you think you're equal to him?

8
828:43:30,934 --> 969:06:50,934
Go back to your mountain now and behave yourself."

9
969:08:30,934 --> 1025:11:50,934
[g@"No," said Wukong.

10
1025:13:30,934 --> 1124:51:50,934
"I'm not leaving until I get to rule Heaven."@g]

11
1124:53:30,934 --> 1198:40:10,934
[g@Buddha thought for a minute.

12
1198:41:50,934 --> 1347:58:30,934
"Sun Wukong, what powers do you have?"@g]

13
1348:00:10,934 --> 1440:53:30,934
"I can change into other animals," said Wukong.

14
1440:55:10,934 --> 1515:11:50,934
[g@"I can soar through the sky on clouds.

15
1515:13:30,934 --> 1609:11:50,934
I can do anything I want!"@g]

16
1609:13:30,934 --> 1693:33:30,934
[g@"Then let's make a bet," said Buddha.

17
1693:35:10,934 --> 1810:10:10,934
"If you win, you can rule Heaven.@g]

18
1810:11:50,934 --> 1956:25:10,934
The Jade Emperor will come to live with me in the Western Paradise.

19
1956:26:50,934 --> 2091:41:50,934
But if you lose, you will be punished severely."

20
2091:43:30,934 --> 2186:46:50,934
"What do I have to do?" asked Wukong.

21
2186:48:30,934 --> 2269:03:30,934
[g@"It's simple," said Buddha.

22
2269:05:10,934 --> 2344:38:30,934
He held out his hand.@g]

23
2344:40:10,934 --> 2488:01:50,934
"You just have to jump off my hand."

24
2488:03:30,934 --> 2594:10:10,934
[g@Wukong laughed. "That's easy!

25
2594:11:50,934 --> 2689:03:30,934
I can jump across entire oceans!"@g]

26
2689:05:10,934 --> 2960:41:50,934
Buddha smiled. "Well then, let's see you do it."

27
2960:43:30,934 --> 3087:46:50,934
Wukong stepped up onto Buddha's palm.

28
3087:48:30,934 --> 3174:30:10,934
"You're a fool," he said to Buddha.

29
3174:31:50,934 --> 3273:35:10,934
"I'm going to jump farther than you could ever imagine.

30
3273:36:50,934 --> 3375:31:50,934
When I return, I'll be the ruler of Heaven!"

31
3375:33:30,934 --> 3562:33:30,934
Wukong leaped and soared through the air.

32
3562:35:10,934 --> 3704:21:50,934
After a long time, he saw five enormous pillars.

33
3704:23:30,934 --> 3782:40:10,934
He landed in front of them.

34
3782:41:50,934 --> 3886:36:50,934
"This must be the end of the world," he said to himself.

35
3886:38:30,934 --> 4007:26:50,934
"I'll go back now and tell Buddha to take the Jade Emperor away.

36
4007:28:30,934 --> 4082:20:10,934
Heaven is mine!"

37
4082:21:50,934 --> 4224:16:50,934
Wukong was just about to jump back when he thought of something.

38
4224:18:30,934 --> 4305:15:10,934
"There's nobody around," he thought.

39
4305:16:50,934 --> 4365:13:30,934
[g@"How will I prove that I was here?"

40
4365:15:10,934 --> 4431:58:30,934
He tapped his chin.@g]

41
4432:00:10,934 --> 4490:48:30,934
[g@"I'll write a note on this pillar.

42
4490:50:10,934 --> 4555:06:50,934
Buddha can come here and check."@g]

43
4555:08:30,934 --> 4767:35:10,934
Wukong plucked two hairs and turned them into a brush and a jar of ink.

44
4767:36:50,934 --> 4972:28:30,934
On one of the pillars, he wrote: [i@Sun Wukong was here.@i]

45
4972:30:10,934 --> 5024:16:50,934
[g@"There," said Wukong.

46
5024:18:30,934 --> 5125:46:50,934
"Now I'll go and tell Buddha how far I jumped."@g]

47
5125:48:30,934 --> 5286:06:50,934
Wukong leaped once more.

48
5286:08:30,934 --> 5398:21:50,934
After a long time, he landed on Buddha's palm again.

49
5398:23:30,934 --> 5554:15:10,934
"I'm back!" said Wukong. "Tell the Jade Emperor to leave."

50
5554:16:50,934 --> 5673:31:50,934
[g@Buddha frowned. "How can you say you're back?

51
5673:33:30,934 --> 5792:10:10,934
You never left my hand."@g]

52
5792:11:50,934 --> 5871:36:50,934
[g@Wukong was confused.

53
5871:38:30,934 --> 5991:35:10,934
"Yes, I did! I reached the end of the world.@g]

54
5991:36:50,934 --> 6047:35:10,934
[g@There were five enormous pillars.

55
6047:36:50,934 --> 6093:46:50,934
I even wrote on one.@g]

56
6093:48:30,934 --> 6153:03:30,934
Come with me and I'll show you."

57
6153:05:10,934 --> 6259:30:10,934
[g@"There's no need to go anywhere," said Buddha.

58
6259:31:50,934 --> 6350:06:50,934
"Just look down."@g]

59
6350:08:30,934 --> 6470:20:10,934
Wukong looked down.

60
6470:21:50,934 --> 6569:01:50,934
Near the bottom of Buddha's middle finger was the note:

61
6569:03:30,934 --> 6644:40:10,934
[i@Sun Wukong was here.@i]

62
6644:41:50,934 --> 6729:21:50,934
[g@Wukong stomped his foot.

63
6729:23:30,934 --> 6841:31:50,934
"It's a trick! You used some sort of magic!"@g]

64
6841:33:30,934 --> 6921:00:10,934
[g@"It's not a trick," said Buddha.

65
6921:01:50,934 --> 7076:31:50,934
"You never left my palm."@g]

66
7076:33:30,934 --> 7160:36:50,934
[g@"I did! I did!" cried Wukong.

67
7160:38:30,934 --> 7214:28:30,934
"I jumped all the way toâ€”"@g]

68
7214:30:10,934 --> 7335:06:50,934
[g@"You lost the bet, Sun Wukong," said Buddha.

69
7335:08:30,934 --> 7428:25:10,934
"And now you will be punished."@g]

70
7428:26:50,934 --> 7594:20:10,934
Holding Wukong tightly, Buddha reached down to Earth.

71
7594:21:50,934 --> 7755:30:10,934
His hand turned into a mountain, which he placed on top of the monkey.

72
7755:31:50,934 --> 7906:45:10,934
"Grr!" Wukong grunted, and pushed with all his strength.

73
7906:46:50,934 --> 7987:05:10,934
The mountain started to rise.

74
7987:06:50,934 --> 8126:20:10,934
Buddha pulled a small sheet of magic paper from his sleeve.

75
8126:21:50,934 --> 8235:21:50,934
[g@He laid the paper on top of the mountain.

76
8235:23:30,934 --> 8312:36:50,934
The mountain dropped back down.@g]

77
8312:38:30,934 --> 8402:35:10,934
Buddha turned to the Jade Emperor.

78
8402:36:50,934 --> 8579:30:10,934
"Sun Wukong can't lift the mountain now," he said.

79
8579:31:50,934 --> 8788:46:50,934
"He will be trapped until his punishment is over."
