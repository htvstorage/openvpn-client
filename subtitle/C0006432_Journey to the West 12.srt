00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:13,850
[g@Buddha smiled at Wukong.

2
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:17,572
"How did you get so powerful?"@g]

3
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:24,568
"A sage taught me secret formulas," said Wukong.

4
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:27,439
[g@"I practiced them for many years.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,492
I am now equal to the Jade Emperor."@g]

6
00:00:30,493 --> 00:00:37,421
"The Jade Emperor has been practicing the same [n@formulas for many lifetimes," said Buddha.

7
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:40,767
"How can you think you're equal to him?

8
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:45,822
Go back to your mountain now and behave yourself."

9
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:47,841
[g@"No," said Wukong.

10
00:00:47,842 --> 00:00:51,429
"I'm not leaving until I get to rule Heaven."@g]

11
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,086
[g@Buddha thought for a minute.

12
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:59,461
"Sun Wukong, what powers do you have?"@g]

13
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:02,806
"I can change into other animals," said Wukong.

14
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:05,481
[g@"I can soar through the sky on clouds.

15
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,865
I can do anything I want!"@g]

16
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:11,902
[g@"Then let's make a bet," said Buddha.

17
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:16,100
"If you win, you can rule Heaven.@g]

18
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:21,365
The Jade Emperor will come to live with me in the Western Paradise.

19
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:26,235
But if you lose, you will be punished severely."

20
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:29,658
"What do I have to do?" asked Wukong.

21
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,620
[g@"It's simple," said Buddha.

22
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:35,341
He held out his hand.@g]

23
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:40,503
"You just have to jump off my hand."

24
00:01:40,504 --> 00:01:44,324
[g@Wukong laughed. "That's easy!

25
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:47,740
I can jump across entire oceans!"@g]

26
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:57,519
Buddha smiled. "Well then, let's see you do it."

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,094
Wukong stepped up onto Buddha's palm.

28
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:05,216
"You're a fool," he said to Buddha.

29
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:08,783
"I'm going to jump farther than you could ever imagine.

30
00:02:08,784 --> 00:02:12,453
When I return, I'll be the ruler of Heaven!"

31
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:19,186
Wukong leaped and soared through the air.

32
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:24,291
After a long time, he saw five enormous pillars.

33
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:27,110
He landed in front of them.

34
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:30,852
"This must be the end of the world," he said to himself.

35
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:35,202
"I'll go back now and tell Buddha to take the Jade Emperor away.

36
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:37,898
Heaven is mine!"

37
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:43,008
Wukong was just about to jump back when he thought of something.

38
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:45,923
"There's nobody around," he thought.

39
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:48,082
[g@"How will I prove that I was here?"

40
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,485
He tapped his chin.@g]

41
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:52,603
[g@"I'll write a note on this pillar.

42
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:54,918
Buddha can come here and check."@g]

43
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:02,567
Wukong plucked two hairs and turned them into a brush and a jar of ink.

44
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:09,943
On one of the pillars, he wrote: [i@Sun Wukong was here.@i]

45
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:11,808
[g@"There," said Wukong.

46
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:15,462
"Now I'll go and tell Buddha how far I jumped."@g]

47
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:21,234
Wukong leaped once more.

48
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:25,275
After a long time, he landed on Buddha's palm again.

49
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:30,887
"I'm back!" said Wukong. "Tell the Jade Emperor to leave."

50
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:35,181
[g@Buddha frowned. "How can you say you're back?

51
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:39,452
You never left my hand."@g]

52
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,312
[g@Wukong was confused.

53
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:46,631
"Yes, I did! I reached the end of the world.@g]

54
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:48,647
[g@There were five enormous pillars.

55
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:50,310
I even wrote on one.@g]

56
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:52,444
Come with me and I'll show you."

57
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:56,276
[g@"There's no need to go anywhere," said Buddha.

58
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,538
"Just look down."@g]

59
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:03,866
Wukong looked down.

60
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:07,419
Near the bottom of Buddha's middle finger was the note:

61
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,142
[i@Sun Wukong was here.@i]

62
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:13,191
[g@Wukong stomped his foot.

63
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:17,229
"It's a trick! You used some sort of magic!"@g]

64
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,090
[g@"It's not a trick," said Buddha.

65
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:25,689
"You never left my palm."@g]

66
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,716
[g@"I did! I did!" cried Wukong.

67
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,655
"I jumped all the way toâ€”"@g]

68
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:34,998
[g@"You lost the bet, Sun Wukong," said Buddha.

69
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:38,357
"And now you will be punished."@g]

70
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:44,330
Holding Wukong tightly, Buddha reached down to Earth.

71
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:50,132
His hand turned into a mountain, which he placed on top of the monkey.

72
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:55,577
"Grr!" Wukong grunted, and pushed with all his strength.

73
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:58,469
The mountain started to rise.

74
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,482
Buddha pulled a small sheet of magic paper from his sleeve.

75
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:07,407
[g@He laid the paper on top of the mountain.

76
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:10,188
The mountain dropped back down.@g]

77
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:13,427
Buddha turned to the Jade Emperor.

78
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:19,796
"Sun Wukong can't lift the mountain now," he said.

79
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:27,330
"He will be trapped until his punishment is over."
