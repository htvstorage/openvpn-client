1
00:00:11,000 --> 222:18:31,000
Wukong gasped as his companions began to look ill.

2
222:20:11,000 --> 381:46:51,000
The Tang Monk's head bobbed forward, and his teacup dropped from his hand.

3
381:48:31,000 --> 452:20:11,000
[g@And thenâ€”[i@thump!@i]

4
452:21:51,000 --> 515:25:11,000
The monk toppled to the floor.@g]

5
515:26:51,000 --> 707:11:51,000
A moment later Wujing and Bajie passed out too.

6
707:13:31,000 --> 863:16:51,000
"Evil villain!" Wukong jumped to his feet and pulled out his iron bar.

7
863:18:31,000 --> 920:50:11,000
The priest backed away.

8
920:51:51,000 --> 1086:56:51,000
Just then a door burst open, and the three women ran into the room.

9
1086:58:31,000 --> 1162:08:31,000
"You again?" cried the monkey.

10
1162:10:11,000 --> 1268:46:51,000
He leaped out of the way as the women shot webs at him.

11
1268:48:31,000 --> 1419:23:31,000
He jumped up, did a flip in the air, and landed directly behind the women.

12
1419:25:11,000 --> 1508:00:11,000
Furiously, he slammed his iron bar down.

13
1508:01:51,000 --> 1620:35:11,000
[i@Wham!@i] There was a puff of smoke.

14
1620:36:51,000 --> 1767:48:31,000
When it cleared, a dead spider lay where one of the women had been.

15
1767:50:11,000 --> 1849:53:31,000
The other two women stared in horror.

16
1849:55:11,000 --> 1937:31:51,000
"He destroyed our sister!" cried one.

17
1937:33:31,000 --> 2043:38:31,000
"He's a monster!" cried the other.

18
2043:40:11,000 --> 2108:01:51,000
Wukong charged toward them.

19
2108:03:31,000 --> 2297:38:31,000
He knocked flying webs out of his way and then . . . [i@Crack! Bam!@i]

20
2297:40:11,000 --> 2363:36:51,000
[g@Both women were gone.

21
2363:38:31,000 --> 2478:15:11,000
In their places lay dead spiders.@g]

22
2478:16:51,000 --> 2599:13:31,000
"Those spider spirits were my dear friends!" cried the priest.

23
2599:15:11,000 --> 2680:48:31,000
[g@His eyes burned with fury.

24
2680:50:11,000 --> 2773:16:51,000
"You will regret destroying them."@g]

25
2773:18:31,000 --> 2914:20:11,000
The priest opened his robe, revealing a body covered in eyes.

26
2914:21:51,000 --> 3066:15:11,000
Suddenly, blinding light shot from the many eyes.

27
3066:16:51,000 --> 3212:31:51,000
"Aargh! The light is too bright!" cried the monkey.

28
3212:33:31,000 --> 3331:38:31,000
He covered his own eyes and ran all over the room.

29
3331:40:11,000 --> 3430:03:31,000
But he couldn't escape the blinding light.

30
3430:05:11,000 --> 3559:08:31,000
Finally he slammed his iron bar into the abbey's stone floor.

31
3559:10:11,000 --> 3648:10:11,000
[g@A huge hole opened up.

32
3648:11:51,000 --> 3770:23:31,000
The monkey jumped in and turned into a mole.@g]

33
3770:25:11,000 --> 3923:20:11,000
Using his claws, he tunneled until he was sure he was far from the abbey.

34
3923:21:51,000 --> 4070:46:51,000
When Wukong popped up out of the ground, he turned back into himself.

35
4070:48:31,000 --> 4161:20:11,000
Bright light was shining from the abbey.

36
4161:21:51,000 --> 4281:08:31,000
Even from far away, the light burned the monkey's eyes.

37
4281:10:11,000 --> 4353:48:31,000
Wukong turned away.

38
4353:50:11,000 --> 4402:36:51,000
[g@"What will I do?

39
4402:38:31,000 --> 4473:56:51,000
I have no way to save my friends.@g]

40
4473:58:31,000 --> 4569:46:51,000
That priest's light is too powerful."

41
4569:48:31,000 --> 4669:15:11,000
[g@He sobbed and sobbed until he heard a voice say,

42
4669:16:51,000 --> 4739:00:11,000
"Don't cry, Wukong."@g]

43
4739:01:51,000 --> 4784:16:51,000
[g@The monkey looked up.

44
4784:18:31,000 --> 4887:38:31,000
A tall woman was standing over him.@g]

45
4887:40:11,000 --> 4993:15:11,000
"I am the bodhisattva Pralambra," said the woman.

46
4993:16:51,000 --> 5146:05:11,000
"That priest is a centipede spirit, called the Demon Lord of Many Eyes.

47
5146:06:51,000 --> 5259:35:11,000
I am the only one who can defeat him."

48
5259:36:51,000 --> 5360:35:11,000
Pralambra pulled a small needle from her sleeve.

49
5360:36:51,000 --> 5456:28:31,000
Turning, she threw the needle into the beams of light.

50
5456:30:11,000 --> 5700:06:51,000
[i@Crack!@i] The sound thundered in the sky, and the beams of light vanished.

51
5700:08:31,000 --> 5815:38:31,000
Wukong and Pralambra returned to the abbey.

52
5815:40:11,000 --> 5889:46:51,000
[g@The priest lay shaking on the floor.

53
5889:48:31,000 --> 5978:06:51,000
All of his eyes were squeezed shut.@g]

54
5978:08:31,000 --> 6160:03:31,000
Pralambra pointed her finger at the priest, [n@and he turned into a giant centipede.

55
6160:05:11,000 --> 6248:31:51,000
Pralambra took a bottle out of her sleeve.

56
6248:33:31,000 --> 6331:15:11,000
"Here, Wukong," said the bodhisattva.

57
6331:16:51,000 --> 6420:46:51,000
"These pills will cure your companions.

58
6420:48:31,000 --> 6551:15:11,000
I will take the centipede with me to be punished."

59
6551:16:51,000 --> 6806:53:31,000
Wukong bowed. "Thank you, Bodhisattva."

60
6806:55:11,000 --> 6924:35:11,000
The journey continued, and many weeks went by.

61
6924:36:51,000 --> 7043:20:11,000
"The journey has been easy lately," said the Tang Monk one day.

62
7043:21:51,000 --> 7114:25:11,000
Bajie snorted.

63
7114:26:51,000 --> 7178:00:11,000
"That's true," said Wujing.

64
7178:01:51,000 --> 7307:23:31,000
"It's been weeks since any demons tried to eat Master."

65
7307:25:11,000 --> 7443:36:51,000
"The Western Paradise is still far away," Wukong warned the others.

66
7443:38:31,000 --> 7546:20:11,000
"We'll face many more dangers before we get there."

67
7546:21:51,000 --> 7609:16:51,000
The Tang Monk smiled.

68
7609:18:31,000 --> 7710:51:51,000
[g@"Relax, Wukong, and enjoy the beautiful day.

69
7710:53:31,000 --> 7827:15:11,000
There is no danger here."@g]

70
7827:16:51,000 --> 7925:26:51,000
[g@Just then a man appeared up ahead.

71
7925:28:31,000 --> 8008:35:11,000
He was waving his arms frantically.@g]

72
8008:36:51,000 --> 8092:00:11,000
"Don't come this way!" shouted the man.

73
8092:01:51,000 --> 8311:48:31,000
"There's danger aheadâ€”great danger!"
