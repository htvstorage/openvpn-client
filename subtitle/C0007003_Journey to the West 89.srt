1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,003
Wukong gasped as his companions began to look ill.

2
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:24,744
The Tang Monk's head bobbed forward, and his teacup dropped from his hand.

3
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:27,284
[g@And then—[i@thump!@i]

4
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:29,555
The monk toppled to the floor.@g]

5
00:00:29,556 --> 00:00:36,459
A moment later Wujing and Bajie passed out too.

6
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,078
"Evil villain!" Wukong jumped to his feet and pulled out his iron bar.

7
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,150
The priest backed away.

8
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:50,130
Just then a door burst open, and the three women ran into the room.

9
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:52,837
"You again?" cried the monkey.

10
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:56,676
He leaped out of the way as the women shot webs at him.

11
00:00:56,677 --> 00:01:02,098
He jumped up, did a flip in the air, and landed directly behind the women.

12
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:05,288
Furiously, he slammed his iron bar down.

13
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:09,341
[i@Wham!@i] There was a puff of smoke.

14
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:14,641
When it cleared, a dead spider lay where one of the women had been.

15
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:17,596
The other two women stared in horror.

16
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:20,751
"He destroyed our sister!" cried one.

17
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:24,571
"He's a monster!" cried the other.

18
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:26,889
Wukong charged toward them.

19
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:33,715
He knocked flying webs out of his way and then . . . [i@Crack! Bam!@i]

20
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:36,090
[g@Both women were gone.

21
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:40,217
In their places lay dead spiders.@g]

22
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:44,572
"Those spider spirits were my dear friends!" cried the priest.

23
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:47,509
[g@His eyes burned with fury.

24
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,838
"You will regret destroying them."@g]

25
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:55,916
The priest opened his robe, revealing a body covered in eyes.

26
00:01:55,917 --> 00:02:01,385
Suddenly, blinding light shot from the many eyes.

27
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:06,651
"Aargh! The light is too bright!" cried the monkey.

28
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:10,939
He covered his own eyes and ran all over the room.

29
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,482
But he couldn't escape the blinding light.

30
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:19,129
Finally he slammed his iron bar into the abbey's stone floor.

31
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,334
[g@A huge hole opened up.

32
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:26,734
The monkey jumped in and turned into a mole.@g]

33
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:32,240
Using his claws, he tunneled until he was sure he was far from the abbey.

34
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:37,548
When Wukong popped up out of the ground, he turned back into himself.

35
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:40,808
Bright light was shining from the abbey.

36
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:45,121
Even from far away, the light burned the monkey's eyes.

37
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:47,737
Wukong turned away.

38
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:49,494
[g@"What will I do?

39
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:52,062
I have no way to save my friends.@g]

40
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:55,512
That priest's light is too powerful."

41
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:59,093
[g@He sobbed and sobbed until he heard a voice say,

42
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:01,604
"Don't cry, Wukong."@g]

43
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:03,234
[g@The monkey looked up.

44
00:03:03,235 --> 00:03:06,955
A tall woman was standing over him.@g]

45
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:10,757
"I am the bodhisattva Pralambra," said the woman.

46
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:16,259
"That priest is a centipede spirit, called the Demon Lord of Many Eyes.

47
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,345
I am the only one who can defeat him."

48
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:23,981
Pralambra pulled a small needle from her sleeve.

49
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:27,433
Turning, she threw the needle into the beams of light.

50
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:36,204
[i@Crack!@i] The sound thundered in the sky, and the beams of light vanished.

51
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:40,363
Wukong and Pralambra returned to the abbey.

52
00:03:40,364 --> 00:03:43,032
[g@The priest lay shaking on the floor.

53
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:46,212
All of his eyes were squeezed shut.@g]

54
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:52,762
Pralambra pointed her finger at the priest, [n@and he turned into a giant centipede.

55
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:55,947
Pralambra took a bottle out of her sleeve.

56
00:03:55,948 --> 00:03:58,925
"Here, Wukong," said the bodhisattva.

57
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:02,148
"These pills will cure your companions.

58
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:06,845
I will take the centipede with me to be punished."

59
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:16,048
Wukong bowed. "Thank you, Bodhisattva."

60
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:20,285
The journey continued, and many weeks went by.

61
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:24,560
"The journey has been easy lately," said the Tang Monk one day.

62
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:27,119
Bajie snorted.

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,408
"That's true," said Wujing.

64
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:34,066
"It's been weeks since any demons tried to eat Master."

65
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:38,970
"The Western Paradise is still far away," Wukong warned the others.

66
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:42,668
"We'll face many more dangers before we get there."

67
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,934
The Tang Monk smiled.

68
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:48,591
[g@"Relax, Wukong, and enjoy the beautiful day.

69
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:52,781
There is no danger here."@g]

70
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:56,316
[g@Just then a man appeared up ahead.

71
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:59,309
He was waving his arms frantically.@g]

72
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,312
"Don't come this way!" shouted the man.

73
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:10,225
"There's danger ahead—great danger!"
