00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 209:50:10,933.3329999446869
Wukong and his companions were walking through a forest.

2
209:51:50,933.3329999446869 --> 328:15:10,933.3329999446869
"I'm glad the road goes through this shady forest," said the Tang Monk.

3
328:16:50,933.3329999446869 --> 403:53:30,933.3329999446869
"The sun is very hot this morning."

4
403:55:10,933.3329999446869 --> 516:55:10,933.3329999446869
Wujing nodded. "It's nice to walk in the shade."

5
516:56:50,933.3329999446869 --> 604:08:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong looked around suspiciously.

6
604:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 717:05:10,933.3330001831055
He knew that forests were often filled with dangers.

7
717:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 867:53:30,933.3330001831055
Suddenly Bajie fell flat on his face. "Oof!"

8
867:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 969:55:10,933.3330001831055
He climbed back to his feet and rubbed his nose.

9
969:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1025:23:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"I'm okay," he said.

10
1025:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1158:18:30,933.3330001831055
"I tripped on a rock."@g]

11
1158:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1282:53:30,933.3330001831055
The travelers soon came to a wall running along the road.

12
1282:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1385:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Behind the wall they could see the roof of a house.

13
1385:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1460:08:30,933.3330001831055
Up ahead was a gate.@g]

14
1460:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1585:21:50,933.3330001831055
"I wonder who lives here," said Wujing.

15
1585:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1692:25:10,933.3330001831055
"Shh," said Wukong. "I hear laughter."

16
1692:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1763:48:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey peeked over the wall.

17
1763:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1891:35:10,933.3330001831055
Three young women were laughing and kicking a ball around.

18
1891:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1992:46:50,933.3330001831055
"I see three young women," said Wukong.

19
1992:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2089:05:10,933.3330001831055
"Let's ask them for some food," said Wujing.

20
2089:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2162:11:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"That's a good idea," said Bajie.

21
2162:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2212:01:50,933.3330001831055
"I'll go talk to them."@g]

22
2212:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2279:08:30,933.3330001831055
The pig headed toward the gate.

23
2279:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2384:01:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Bajie, wait here," said the Tang Monk.

24
2384:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2455:48:30,933.3330001831055
He looked at his companions.@g]

25
2455:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2502:58:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"I will speak to the women.

26
2503:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2562:10:10,933.3330001831055
You three might frighten them."@g]

27
2562:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2647:11:50,933.3330001831055
"Frighten them?" Bajie echoed.

28
2647:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2719:23:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

29
2719:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2832:03:30,933.3330001831055
"After all, Bajie, you're a large, talking pig.@g]

30
2832:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2910:33:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wujing, you're big and purple.

31
2910:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3031:01:50,933.3330001831055
And, Wukong, you're scary sometimes."@g]

32
3031:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3095:23:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey shrugged.

33
3095:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3183:26:50,933.3330001831055
Wujing nodded.

34
3183:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3347:33:30,933.3330001831055
"Fine," snapped Bajie.

35
3347:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3472:16:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk opened the gate and went through.

36
3472:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3569:53:30,933.3330001831055
He approached the women.@g]

37
3569:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3692:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Look!" said one woman. "We have a visitor."

38
3692:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3777:18:30,933.3330001831055
"He's a monk," said another woman.

39
3777:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3886:28:30,933.3330001831055
"What can we do for you?" asked the third.

40
3886:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3958:08:30,933.3330001831055
"Hello," said the Tang Monk.

41
3958:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4135:25:10,933.3330001831055
"I'm wondering if you could spare some food for my companions and me."

42
4135:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4215:31:50,933.3330001831055
The three women smiled.

43
4215:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4330:28:30,933.3330001831055
"Of course we can spare some food!" said the first woman.

44
4330:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4434:10:10,933.3330001831055
"We have plenty," said the second woman.

45
4434:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4516:36:50,933.3330001831055
"Come inside our house," said the third.

46
4516:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4692:48:30,933.3330001831055
The three young women led the Tang Monk into their house.

47
4692:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4811:36:50,933.3330001831055
As soon as the monk entered, he became scared.

48
4811:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4930:01:50,933.3330001831055
The interior of the house was dark and dreary.

49
4930:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5065:13:30,933.3330001831055
Dust covered everything, and cobwebs hung from the walls.

50
5065:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5141:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Tell us, monk," said one woman.

51
5141:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5239:13:30,933.3330001831055
"Why are you walking through our forest today?"

52
5239:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5331:43:30,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk looked around nervously.

53
5331:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5488:46:50,933.3330001831055
"I, um . . . I'm going to the Western Paradise toâ€”"

54
5488:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5614:11:50,933.3330001831055
"You're the Tang Monk!" shrieked all three women.

55
5614:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5684:23:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk took a step back.

56
5684:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5766:56:50,933.3330001831055
"You've . . . heard of me?"@g]

57
5766:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5839:48:30,933.3330001831055
"Of course," said one woman.

58
5839:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5932:03:30,933.3330001831055
All three women reached behind their heads.

59
5932:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6068:31:50,933.3330001831055
They began to pull out long strands of spider silk.

60
6068:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6278:23:30,933.3330001831055
Swiftly they moved toward the Tang Monk.

61
6278:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6416:21:50,933.3330001831055
"What's taking Master so long?" asked Wukong.

62
6416:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6529:55:10,933.3330001831055
The monk's companions were waiting outside in the road.

63
6529:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6684:10:10,933.3330001831055
"He's probably inside that house, enjoying a nice meal," said Bajie.

64
6684:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6804:56:50,933.3330001831055
"Meanwhile, we're out here, starving."

65
6804:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6931:13:30,933.3330001831055
"The Tang Monk wouldn't do that, Bajie," said Wujing.

66
6931:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6981:46:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong looked worried.

67
6981:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7069:33:30,933.3330001831055
"We'd better check on Master."@g]

68
7069:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7180:01:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"If there's food, I want to be there," said Bajie.

69
7180:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7236:26:50,933.3330001831055
"I'll go with you."@g]

70
7236:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7318:20:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The two of them went to the gate.

71
7318:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7505:26:50,933.3330001831055
When they saw the house, they both gasped.@g]

72
7505:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7649:28:30,933.3330001831055
"The house is covered in spiderwebs!" cried the pig.

73
7649:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7777:28:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong kicked in the gate, and they rushed toward the house.

74
7777:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7882:16:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey banged on the door. "Open up!"

75
7882:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7941:46:50,933.3330001831055
The door flew open.

76
7941:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8100:00:10,933.3330001831055
The three women leaped out, shooting sticky webs at Wukong and Bajie.

77
8100:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8177:30:10,933.3330001831055
The pig waved his rake.

78
8177:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8371:10:10,933.3330001831055
Webs wrapped around it, and soon the weapon was stuck to his head.

79
8371:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8502:20:10,933.3330001831055
Bajie turned to run, but more webs flew toward him.

80
8502:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8773:48:30,933.3330001831055
They wrapped around his legs, and he fell to the ground.
