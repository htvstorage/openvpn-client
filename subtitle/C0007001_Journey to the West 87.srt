1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:18,487
Wukong and his companions were walking through a forest.

2
00:00:18,488 --> 00:00:22,750
"I'm glad the road goes through this shady forest," said the Tang Monk.

3
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:25,473
"The sun is very hot this morning."

4
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:29,542
Wujing nodded. "It's nice to walk in the shade."

5
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:32,682
Wukong looked around suspiciously.

6
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:36,748
He knew that forests were often filled with dangers.

7
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:42,177
Suddenly Bajie fell flat on his face. "Oof!"

8
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:45,850
He climbed back to his feet and rubbed his nose.

9
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:47,847
"I'm okay," he said.

10
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:52,632
"I tripped on a rock."

11
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:57,117
The travelers soon came to a wall running along the road.

12
00:00:57,118 --> 00:01:00,826
Behind the wall they could see the roof of a house.

13
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,498
Up ahead was a gate.

14
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:08,006
"I wonder who lives here," said Wujing.

15
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:11,860
"Shh," said Wukong. "I hear laughter."

16
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:14,430
The monkey peeked over the wall.

17
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:19,030
Three young women were laughing and kicking a ball around.

18
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:22,673
"I see three young women," said Wukong.

19
00:01:22,674 --> 00:01:26,140
"Let's ask them for some food," said Wujing.

20
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:28,772
"That's a good idea," said Bajie.

21
00:01:28,773 --> 00:01:30,566
"I'll go talk to them."

22
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:32,982
The pig headed toward the gate.

23
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:36,758
"Bajie, wait here," said the Tang Monk.

24
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:39,342
He looked at his companions.

25
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:41,040
"I will speak to the women.

26
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,171
You three might frighten them."

27
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:46,232
"Frighten them?" Bajie echoed.

28
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:48,831
"Yes," said the Tang Monk.

29
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:52,887
"After all, Bajie, you're a large, talking pig.

30
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:55,713
Wujing, you're big and purple.

31
00:01:55,714 --> 00:02:00,050
And, Wukong, you're scary sometimes."

32
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:02,367
The monkey shrugged.

33
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,537
Wujing nodded.

34
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:11,445
"Fine," snapped Bajie.

35
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:15,935
The Tang Monk opened the gate and went through.

36
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,449
He approached the women.

37
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,873
"Look!" said one woman. "We have a visitor."

38
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:26,916
"He's a monk," said another woman.

39
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:30,846
"What can we do for you?" asked the third.

40
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:33,426
"Hello," said the Tang Monk.

41
00:02:33,427 --> 00:02:39,808
"I'm wondering if you could spare some food for my companions and me."

42
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:42,692
The three women smiled.

43
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:46,830
"Of course we can spare some food!" said the first woman.

44
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:50,563
"We have plenty," said the second woman.

45
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:53,531
"Come inside our house," said the third.

46
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:59,874
The three young women led the Tang Monk into their house.

47
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:04,151
As soon as the monk entered, he became scared.

48
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:08,414
The interior of the house was dark and dreary.

49
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:13,281
Dust covered everything, and cobwebs hung from the walls.

50
00:03:13,282 --> 00:03:16,027
"Tell us, monk," said one woman.

51
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:19,545
"Why are you walking through our forest today?"

52
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:22,875
The Tang Monk looked around nervously.

53
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:28,529
"I, um . . . I'm going to the Western Paradise toâ€”"

54
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,044
"You're the Tang Monk!" shrieked all three women.

55
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,571
The Tang Monk took a step back.

56
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:38,543
"You've . . . heard of me?"

57
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:41,166
"Of course," said one woman.

58
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:44,487
All three women reached behind their heads.

59
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:49,400
They began to pull out long strands of spider silk.

60
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:56,955
Swiftly they moved toward the Tang Monk.

61
00:03:56,956 --> 00:04:01,922
"What's taking Master so long?" asked Wukong.

62
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:06,010
The monk's companions were waiting outside in the road.

63
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:11,563
"He's probably inside that house, enjoying a nice meal," said Bajie.

64
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:15,911
"Meanwhile, we're out here, starving."

65
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:20,457
"The Tang Monk wouldn't do that, Bajie," said Wujing.

66
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,277
Wukong looked worried.

67
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:25,437
"We'd better check on Master."

68
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:29,414
"If there's food, I want to be there," said Bajie.

69
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,445
"I'll go with you."

70
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:34,393
The two of them went to the gate.

71
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:41,129
When they saw the house, they both gasped.

72
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,314
"The house is covered in spiderwebs!" cried the pig.

73
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:50,922
Wukong kicked in the gate, and they rushed toward the house.

74
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,695
The monkey banged on the door. "Open up!"

75
00:04:54,696 --> 00:04:56,837
The door flew open.

76
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:02,533
The three women leaped out, shooting sticky webs at Wukong and Bajie.

77
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:05,323
The pig waved his rake.

78
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:12,295
Webs wrapped around it, and soon the weapon was stuck to his head.

79
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:17,017
Bajie turned to run, but more webs flew toward him.

80
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:26,790
They wrapped around his legs, and he fell to the ground.
