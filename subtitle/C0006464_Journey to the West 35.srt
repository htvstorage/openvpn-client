"Princess Hundred Flowers tricked me!" said the monster.

219:45:11,133.3329999446869 --> 287:16:51,133.3329999446869
He stamped his foot.

459:55:11,133.3329999446869 --> 536:25:11,133.3329999446869

[g@The monster thought for a minute.

870:33:31,133.33300018310547 --> 941:30:11,133.33300018310547

941:31:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1118:06:51,133.33300018310547
He went to the princess' room.

10
1118:08:31,133.33300018310547 --> 1197:23:31,133.33300018310547
[g@"My sweet," said the monster.

1197:25:11,133.33300018310547 --> 1288:40:11,133.33300018310547
"I'm going to visit your father."@g]

1288:41:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1417:38:31,133.33300018310547
"What?" said Princess Hundred Flowers in shock.

13
1417:40:11,133.33300018310547 --> 1573:55:11,133.33300018310547
"I'm going to tell him what a nice fellow I am," said the monster.

14
1573:56:51,133.33300018310547 --> 1670:11:51,133.33300018310547
"We can all be a happy family."

15
1670:13:31,133.33300018310547 --> 1970:45:11,133.33300018310547
Before the princess could say another word, the monster left the room.

16
1970:46:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2077:11:51,133.33300018310547
[g@"I need a disguise," he said to himself.

17
2077:13:31,133.33300018310547 --> 2154:50:11,133.33300018310547

2154:51:51,133.33300018310547 --> 2310:13:31,133.33300018310547
Light sparkled. Now the monster looked like a handsome young man.

19
2310:15:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2461:41:51,133.33300018310547
"Ha-ha!" he laughed.

20
2461:43:31,133.33300018310547 --> 2593:13:31,133.33300018310547
Bajie ran back to the Precious Image Kingdom.

21
2593:15:11,133.33300018310547 --> 2744:51:51,133.33300018310547
He told the king that he and Wujing couldn't save Princess Hundred Flowers.

2744:53:31,133.33300018310547 --> 2803:03:31,133.33300018310547

2924:36:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3050:51:51,133.33300018310547
"We must save my daughter," said the king.

25
3050:53:31,133.33300018310547 --> 3105:50:11,133.33300018310547
[g@He turned to his general.

26
3105:51:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3166:46:51,133.33300018310547
"Gather the troops!"@g]

27
3166:48:31,133.33300018310547 --> 3240:23:31,133.33300018310547
A messenger ran into the court.

28
3240:25:11,133.33300018310547 --> 3384:00:11,133.33300018310547
"Your Majesty, your son-in-law is here to see you," said the messenger.

29
3384:01:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3440:10:11,133.33300018310547
[g@The king was confused.

30
3440:11:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3510:21:51,133.33300018310547
"I don't have a son-in-law!"@g]

3510:23:31,133.33300018310547 --> 3609:35:11,133.33300018310547
A handsome young man walked into the hall.

32
3609:36:51,133.33300018310547 --> 3745:38:31,133.33300018310547
"Hello, Father. I'm sorry I haven't visited you until now."

33
3745:40:11,133.33300018310547 --> 3819:43:31,133.33300018310547
"Who are you?" asked the king.

34
3819:45:11,133.33300018310547 --> 4053:03:31,133.33300018310547
"I married Princess Hundred Flowers 13 years ago," said the young man.

35
4053:05:11,133.33300018310547 --> 4171:53:31,133.33300018310547
"I found her in a forest just as a tiger was about to attack her.

36
4171:55:11,133.33300018310547 --> 4252:28:31,133.33300018310547
I saved her life and chased away the tiger."

37
4252:30:11,133.33300018310547 --> 4322:56:51,133.33300018310547
[g@The king relaxed a little.

38
4322:58:31,133.33300018310547 --> 4392:55:11,133.33300018310547
"That was very brave."@g]

39
4392:56:51,133.33300018310547 --> 4496:20:11,133.33300018310547
"Yes, it [i@was@i] very brave," said the young man.

40
4496:21:51,133.33300018310547 --> 4626:40:11,133.33300018310547
"However, that tiger has wanted revenge ever since.

4626:41:51,133.33300018310547 --> 4690:25:11,133.33300018310547
[g@Sometime ago it became a spirit.

42
4690:26:51,133.33300018310547 --> 4797:13:31,133.33300018310547
Now it disguises itself as a monk."@g]

43
4797:15:11,133.33300018310547 --> 4956:36:51,133.33300018310547
The young man narrowed his eyes at the Tang Monk and pointed. "That monk!"

44
4956:38:31,133.33300018310547 --> 5034:05:11,133.33300018310547
"What!" cried the Tang Monk.

45
5034:06:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5137:56:51,133.33300018310547
The king frowned. "I don't believe you."

46
5137:58:31,133.33300018310547 --> 5243:05:11,133.33300018310547
"I'll prove it," said the young man.

47
5243:06:51,133.33300018310547 --> 5433:28:31,133.33300018310547
He pointed at the monk again and recited a spell. Light sparkled.

48
5433:30:11,133.33300018310547 --> 5644:01:51,133.33300018310547
Everybody gasped. Now a tiger sat in the Tang Monk's spot!

49
5644:03:31,133.33300018310547 --> 5783:43:31,133.33300018310547
Later, in the stable, a boy was giving hay to the Tang Monk's horse.

50
5783:45:11,133.33300018310547 --> 5908:21:51,133.33300018310547
"Did you hear about the Tang Monk?" asked another boy.

51
5908:23:31,133.33300018310547 --> 5993:31:51,133.33300018310547
"He was really a tiger spirit.

5993:33:31,133.33300018310547 --> 6125:43:31,133.33300018310547
A handsome young man changed him back into his true form."

53
6125:45:11,133.33300018310547 --> 6270:20:11,133.33300018310547
"Wow," said the first boy. "Where is the tiger now?"

54
6270:21:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6469:21:51,133.33300018310547
"He's locked up in a cage," said the other boy.

55
6469:23:31,133.33300018310547 --> 6607:45:11,133.33300018310547
That night Bajie was sitting alone outside when he heard a voice.

56
6607:46:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6700:36:51,133.33300018310547
"Psst!" said the voice. "Bajie!"

57
6700:38:31,133.33300018310547 --> 6751:50:11,133.33300018310547
[g@Bajie looked around.

58
6751:51:51,133.33300018310547 --> 6821:56:51,133.33300018310547
"Who's calling me?"@g]

59
6821:58:31,133.33300018310547 --> 6959:56:51,133.33300018310547
He saw the horse peeking from behind a wall.

60
6959:58:31,133.33300018310547 --> 7042:13:31,133.33300018310547
"You're talking!" cried Bajie.

61
7042:15:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7157:58:31,133.33300018310547
"Shh," said the horse. "We have a problem.

62
7158:00:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7252:10:11,133.33300018310547
A young man turned the Tang Monk into a tiger.

63
7252:11:51,133.33300018310547 --> 7332:13:31,133.33300018310547
The monk is locked in a cage now."

64
7332:15:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7452:43:31,133.33300018310547
"Oh, I know!" cried Bajie. "It's terrible!

65
7452:45:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7615:11:51,133.33300018310547
Master is now a tiger, and Wujing was captured by a monster."

66
7615:13:31,133.33300018310547 --> 7706:16:51,133.33300018310547
[g@He sighed. "The journey is over.

7706:18:31,133.33300018310547 --> 7765:26:51,133.33300018310547

7765:28:31,133.33300018310547 --> 7837:03:31,133.33300018310547
The horse bit Bajie on the leg.

69
7837:05:11,133.33300018310547 --> 7987:20:11,133.33300018310547
"Ouch!" cried the pig. "Why did you do that?"

70
7987:21:51,133.33300018310547 --> 8061:15:11,133.33300018310547
"We're not going home!" said the horse.

71
8061:16:51,133.33300018310547 --> 8168:45:11,133.33300018310547
"The young man is probably just the monster in disguise.

8168:46:51,133.33300018310547 --> 8281:26:51,133.33300018310547
We need to defeat him and save our companions."

8281:28:31,133.33300018310547 --> 8361:20:11,133.33300018310547
"But how?" asked Bajie.

8361:21:51,133.33300018310547 --> 8424:58:31,133.33300018310547
