1
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:19,043
"Princess Hundred Flowers tricked me!" said the monster.

2
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:21,475
He stamped his foot.

3
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:27,689
[g@Then he sighed. "I can't be angry with her.

4
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,444
I love her too much.@g]

5
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:33,727
[g@But that pig got away.

6
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:38,899
He'll go back to the king, and troops will come."@g]

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,472
[g@The monster thought for a minute.

8
00:00:42,473 --> 00:00:45,027
Finally he had a plan.@g]

9
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:51,385
He went to the princess' room.

10
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:54,239
[g@"My sweet," said the monster.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,525
"I'm going to visit your father."@g]

12
00:00:57,526 --> 00:01:02,168
"What?" said Princess Hundred Flowers in shock.

13
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:07,794
"I'm going to tell him what a nice fellow I am," said the monster.

14
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:11,260
"We can all be a happy family."

15
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:22,080
Before the princess could say another word, the monster left the room.

16
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:25,912
[g@"I need a disguise," he said to himself.

17
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:28,707
He recited a quick spell.@g]

18
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:34,301
Light sparkled. Now the monster looked like a handsome young man.

19
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:39,754
"Ha-ha!" he laughed.

20
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:44,489
Bajie ran back to the Precious Image Kingdom.

21
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,948
He told the king that he and Wujing couldn't save Princess Hundred Flowers.

22
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:52,043
[g@The pig hung his head.

23
00:01:52,044 --> 00:01:56,418
"As I ran away, Wujing was captured."@g]

24
00:01:56,419 --> 00:02:00,964
"We must save my daughter," said the king.

25
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:02,943
[g@He turned to his general.

26
00:02:02,944 --> 00:02:05,137
"Gather the troops!"@g]

27
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,787
A messenger ran into the court.

28
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:12,957
"Your Majesty, your son-in-law is here to see you," said the messenger.

29
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,979
[g@The king was confused.

30
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,506
"I don't have a son-in-law!"@g]

31
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:21,078
A handsome young man walked into the hall.

32
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:25,976
"Hello, Father. I'm sorry I haven't visited you until now."

33
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:28,643
"Who are you?" asked the king.

34
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:37,043
"I married Princess Hundred Flowers 13 years ago," said the young man.

35
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:41,321
"I found her in a forest just as a tiger was about to attack her.

36
00:02:41,322 --> 00:02:44,222
I saved her life and chased away the tiger."

37
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:46,759
[g@The king relaxed a little.

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,278
"That was very brave."@g]

39
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:53,001
"Yes, it [i@was@i] very brave," said the young man.

40
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:57,693
"However, that tiger has wanted revenge ever since.

41
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,988
[g@Sometime ago it became a spirit.

42
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:03,833
Now it disguises itself as a monk."@g]

43
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:09,571
The young man narrowed his eyes at the Tang Monk and pointed. "That monk!"

44
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:12,360
"What!" cried the Tang Monk.

45
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:16,099
The king frowned. "I don't believe you."

46
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,884
"I'll prove it," said the young man.

47
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:26,738
He pointed at the monk again and recited a spell. Light sparkled.

48
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:34,318
Everybody gasped. Now a tiger sat in the Tang Monk's spot!

49
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,347
Later, in the stable, a boy was giving hay to the Tang Monk's horse.

50
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:43,834
"Did you hear about the Tang Monk?" asked another boy.

51
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:46,900
"He was really a tiger spirit.

52
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:51,659
A handsome young man changed him back into his true form."

53
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,865
"Wow," said the first boy. "Where is the tiger now?"

54
00:03:56,866 --> 00:04:04,030
"He's locked up in a cage," said the other boy.

55
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:09,012
That night Bajie was sitting alone outside when he heard a voice.

56
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:12,355
"Psst!" said the voice. "Bajie!"

57
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:14,199
[g@Bajie looked around.

58
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,723
"Who's calling me?"@g]

59
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:21,691
He saw the horse peeking from behind a wall.

60
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:24,653
"You're talking!" cried Bajie.

61
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:28,820
"Shh," said the horse. "We have a problem.

62
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:32,211
A young man turned the Tang Monk into a tiger.

63
00:04:32,212 --> 00:04:35,093
The monk is locked in a cage now."

64
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:39,431
"Oh, I know!" cried Bajie. "It's terrible!

65
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:45,280
Master is now a tiger, and Wujing was captured by a monster."

66
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:48,559
[g@He sighed. "The journey is over.

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,689
Let's just go home."@g]

68
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,267
The horse bit Bajie on the leg.

69
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:58,677
"Ouch!" cried the pig. "Why did you do that?"

70
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:01,338
"We're not going home!" said the horse.

71
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:05,208
"The young man is probably just the monster in disguise.

72
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:09,265
We need to defeat him and save our companions."

73
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:12,141
"But how?" asked Bajie.

74
00:05:12,142 --> 00:05:14,432
The horse thought for a minute.

75
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,607
[g@"You must find Wukong.

76
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,568
He can help us."@g]

77
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,029
[g@Bajie shook his head.

78
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,501
"He won't help us."@g]
