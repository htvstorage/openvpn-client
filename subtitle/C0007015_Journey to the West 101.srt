1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:16,204
"This is ridiculous," said the Tang Monk.

2
00:00:16,205 --> 00:00:18,740
"Why are we under arrest?"

3
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:23,107
Soldiers were bringing the travelers back to the town.

4
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:28,258
"You robbed Squire Kou's house last night," said one of the soldiers.

5
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:30,568
"What!" cried Bajie.

6
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:32,901
"We would never rob somebody.

7
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:37,147
Especially not the squire—he was kind to us!"

8
00:00:37,148 --> 00:00:41,241
"You had all the stolen items," replied the soldier.

9
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:45,271
"You also had the two horses that were stolen from his stable."

10
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:49,607
"We got everything from the real robbers," said the Tang Monk.

11
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:53,010
"We were going to return it all to Squire Kou!"

12
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,556
The soldier laughed.

13
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:59,601
"Oh? You got everything from the real robbers?

14
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:04,103
Tell me, where are the real robbers now? Hmm?"

15
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:06,906
Wukong sighed.

16
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:08,823
"I let them go."

17
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:11,531
The soldier laughed again.

18
00:01:11,532 --> 00:01:14,498
"Oh, that was very kind of you!"

19
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:20,832
Wukong could tell that the soldier didn't believe him.

20
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,286
By now they had reached the town.

21
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:27,785
A crowd of people had gathered to watch.

22
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:31,562
The soldiers brought the travelers into the courthouse.

23
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:34,581
The judge frowned at the monk and the others.

24
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:36,605
"Lock them up!"

25
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:39,960
"This is a mistake," the Tang Monk pleaded.

26
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:41,842
"We can't go to jail.

27
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:45,646
We're making an important journey to visit Buddha."

28
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,551
The judge shook his head.

29
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:51,611
"Buddha doesn't allow killers in the Western Paradise."

30
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,948
"Killers?" said Wujing.

31
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:56,443
"What are you talking about?"

32
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:59,832
"You killed Squire Kou," said the judge.

33
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,191
The Tang Monk's face went pale.

34
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:04,277
"The squire is dead?"

35
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:06,842
The judge narrowed his eyes at the monk.

36
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:13,991
"Yes. And Lady Kou saw you do it."

37
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:19,716
The travelers were shoved into a jail cell, and the door was slammed shut.

38
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:23,556
The Tang Monk started to cry.

39
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:26,585
"This is terrible!"

40
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:29,007
Bajie made a fist.

41
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:31,845
"Lady Kou framed us!"

42
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:34,645
"Yes," said Wujing, nodding.

43
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:38,141
"But why?"

44
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:41,614
"I'll find out tonight," promised Wukong.

45
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:42,852
"Thank you, Wukong."

46
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:45,001
The Tang Monk looked grateful.

47
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:49,325
"We must prove our innocence!"

48
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:58,141
That night Wukong turned into a bee and flew out of the jail and to Squire Kou's house.

49
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:02,688
He found Lady Kou mourning over a coffin.

50
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:07,869
The monkey changed back into himself and hid behind a curtain.

51
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,526
Imitating the squire's voice, he said,

52
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:13,974
"My lady! It's me, your husband."

53
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:17,001
Lady Kou's eyes went wide.

54
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:20,875
"Husband? Is it really you?"

55
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:22,987
"Yes," said Wukong.

56
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:27,527
"Why did you tell the judge that the Tang Monk and his companions killed me?"

57
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:29,440
Lady Kou hesitated.

58
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:33,068
"I . . . I was angry with them.

59
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:37,445
You wanted them to stay here, but they insisted on leaving.

60
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:41,285
That was an insult to us."

61
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:45,536
"You have done a terrible thing!" thundered Wukong.

62
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:49,922
The walls of the house shook, and Lady Kou trembled.

63
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:51,709
The monkey continued.

64
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:57,148
"Tomorrow you must tell the judge that the Tang Monk and his companions are innocent.

65
00:03:57,149 --> 00:04:02,348
If you don't, I will haunt you for the rest of your life!"

66
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:06,333
Tears poured from the woman's eyes.

67
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:10,294
"I will talk to the judge tomorrow, I promise.

68
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:14,129
Please don't haunt me!"

69
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,399
Wukong flew back to the courthouse.

70
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,527
He saw the judge sitting at a desk, reading some papers.

71
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:27,429
Wukong flew over the roof.

72
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:33,066
Then he turned into an enormous spirit body and lowered one foot.

73
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:37,126
When the judge saw the giant foot, he gasped.

74
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:39,683
The papers fell from his hands.

75
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:42,057
Wukong's voice boomed.

76
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:48,495
"I am the Wandering Spirit, and I was sent here by Buddha.

77
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:54,875
Lady Kou lied to you—the Tang Monk didn't kill Squire Kou.

78
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:58,360
The monk is on an important journey.

79
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:04,285
If you don't free him and his companions, I will lower my other foot.

80
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:13,785
Then I will stomp all over this town until there is nothing left!"
