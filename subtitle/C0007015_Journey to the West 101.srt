[g@"This is ridiculous," said the Tang Monk.

2
146:26:50,933.3330000042915 --> 216:51:50,933.3329999446869
"Why are we under arrest?"@g]

3
216:53:30,933.3329999446869 --> 338:10:10,933.3329999446869
Soldiers were bringing the travelers back to the town.

4
338:11:50,933.3329999446869 --> 481:15:10,933.3329999446869
"You robbed Squire Kou's house last night," said one of the soldiers.

5
481:16:50,933.3329999446869 --> 545:25:10,933.3329999446869
[g@"What!" cried Bajie.

6
545:26:50,933.3329999446869 --> 610:13:30,933.3330001831055
"We would never rob somebody.@g]

7
610:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 728:10:10,933.3330001831055
Especially not the squire—he was kind to us!"

8
728:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 841:53:30,933.3330001831055
"You had all the stolen items," replied the soldier.

9
841:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 953:50:10,933.3330001831055
"You also had the two horses that were stolen from his stable."

10
953:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1074:16:50,933.3330001831055
"We got everything from the real robbers," said the Tang Monk.

11
1074:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1168:48:30,933.3330001831055
"We were going to return it all to Squire Kou!"

12
1168:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1239:31:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The soldier laughed.

13
1239:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1351:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Oh? You got everything from the [i@real@i] robbers?@g]

14
1351:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1476:56:50,933.3330001831055
Tell me, where are the [i@real@i] robbers now? Hmm?"

15
1476:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1554:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong sighed.

16
1554:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1608:03:30,933.3330001831055
"I let them go."@g]

17
1608:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1683:16:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The soldier laughed again.

18
1683:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1765:41:50,933.3330001831055
"Oh, that was very kind of you!"@g]

19
1765:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1941:38:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong could tell that the soldier didn't believe him.

20
1941:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2009:48:30,933.3330001831055
[g@By now they had reached the town.

21
2009:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2134:46:50,933.3330001831055
A crowd of people had gathered to watch.@g]

22
2134:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2239:41:50,933.3330001831055
The soldiers brought the travelers into the courthouse.

23
2239:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2323:33:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The judge frowned at the monk and the others.

24
2323:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2379:46:50,933.3330001831055
"Lock them up!"@g]

25
2379:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2472:58:30,933.3330001831055
"This is a mistake," the Tang Monk pleaded.

26
2473:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2525:15:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"We can't go to jail.

27
2525:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2630:55:10,933.3330001831055
We're making an important journey to visit Buddha."@g]

28
2630:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2683:50:10,933.3330001831055
The judge shook his head.

29
2683:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2796:36:50,933.3330001831055
"Buddha doesn't allow killers in the Western Paradise."

30
2796:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2861:31:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Killers?" said Wujing.

31
2861:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2930:50:10,933.3330001831055
"What are you talking about?"@g]

32
2930:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3024:58:30,933.3330001831055
"You killed Squire Kou," said the judge.

33
3025:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3090:30:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk's face went pale.

34
3090:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3148:26:50,933.3330001831055
"The squire is dead?"@g]

35
3148:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3219:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The judge narrowed his eyes at the monk.

36
3219:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3418:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Yes. And Lady Kou saw you do it."@g]

37
3418:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3577:18:30,933.3330001831055
The travelers were shoved into a jail cell, and the door was slammed shut.

38
3577:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3683:58:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk started to cry.

39
3684:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3768:06:50,933.3330001831055
"This is terrible!"@g]

40
3768:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3835:23:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Bajie made a fist.

41
3835:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3914:13:30,933.3330001831055
"Lady Kou framed us!"@g]

42
3914:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3992:00:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Yes," said Wujing, nodding.

43
3992:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4089:06:50,933.3330001831055
"But why?"@g]

44
4089:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4185:35:10,933.3330001831055
"I'll find out tonight," promised Wukong.

45
4185:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4219:58:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Thank you, Wukong."

46
4220:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4279:40:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk looked grateful.@g]

47
4279:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4399:46:50,933.3330001831055
"We must prove our innocence!"

48
4399:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4644:40:10,933.3330001831055
That night Wukong turned into a bee and flew out of [n@the jail and to Squire Kou's house.

49
4644:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4770:58:30,933.3330001831055
He found Lady Kou mourning over a coffin.

50
4771:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4914:53:30,933.3330001831055
The monkey changed back into himself and hid behind a curtain.

51
4914:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4988:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Imitating the squire's voice, he said,

52
4988:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5084:28:30,933.3330001831055
"My lady! It's me, your husband."@g]

53
5084:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5168:33:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Lady Kou's eyes went wide.

54
5168:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5276:10:10,933.3330001831055
"Husband? Is it really you?"@g]

55
5276:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5334:50:10,933.3330001831055
"Yes," said Wukong.

56
5334:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5460:56:50,933.3330001831055
"Why did you tell the judge that the Tang Monk [n@and his companions killed me?"

57
5460:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5514:05:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Lady Kou hesitated.

58
5514:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5614:51:50,933.3330001831055
"I . . . I was angry with them.@g]

59
5614:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5736:26:50,933.3330001831055
You wanted them to stay here, but they insisted on leaving.

60
5736:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5843:06:50,933.3330001831055
That was an insult to us."

61
5843:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5961:11:50,933.3330001831055
"You have done a terrible thing!" thundered Wukong.

62
5961:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6083:01:50,933.3330001831055
The walls of the house shook, and Lady Kou trembled.

63
6083:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6132:40:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey continued.

64
6132:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6283:45:10,933.3330001831055
"Tomorrow you must tell the judge that the Tang Monk [n@and his companions are innocent.

65
6283:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6428:11:50,933.3330001831055
If you don't, I will haunt you for the rest of your life!"

66
6428:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6538:53:30,933.3330001831055
Tears poured from the woman's eyes.

67
6538:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6648:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"I will talk to the judge tomorrow, I promise.

68
6648:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6755:26:50,933.3330001831055
Please don't haunt me!"@g]

69
6755:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6846:16:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong flew back to the courthouse.

70
6846:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6960:56:50,933.3330001831055
He saw the judge sitting at a desk, reading some papers.

71
6960:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7124:53:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong flew over the roof.

72
7124:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7281:28:30,933.3330001831055
Then he turned into an enormous spirit body and lowered one foot.

73
7281:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7394:15:10,933.3330001831055
When the judge saw the giant foot, he gasped.

74
7394:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7465:16:50,933.3330001831055
The papers fell from his hands.

75
7465:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7531:13:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong's voice boomed.

76
7531:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7710:03:30,933.3330001831055
"I am the Wandering Spirit, and I was sent here by Buddha.

77
7710:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7887:16:50,933.3330001831055
Lady Kou lied to you—the Tang Monk didn't kill Squire Kou.

78
7887:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7984:05:10,933.3330001831055
The monk is on an important journey.

79
7984:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8148:40:10,933.3330001831055
If you don't free him and his companions, I will lower my other foot.

80
8148:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8412:33:30,933.3330001831055
Then I will stomp all over this town until there is nothing left!"
