1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,078
The wind stopped.

2
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:22,173
Wukong jumped to his feet and called back the little Wukongs.

3
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:27,213
"Ugh," moaned Bajie. "I need a nap."

4
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:29,537
"Get up!" yelled the monkey.

5
00:00:29,538 --> 00:00:34,599
"We have to save the Tang Monk before the demon king eats him!"

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,822
Bajie rubbed his head.

7
00:00:36,823 --> 00:00:38,492
"How can we save him?

8
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:41,146
That wind was too powerful."

9
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:44,505
Wukong tapped his chin and thought.

10
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:54,546
"I'll sneak into the cave to see what I can find out."

11
00:00:54,547 --> 00:01:01,050
The monkey changed into a mosquito and squeezed through a crack in the cave's door.

12
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:06,499
Deep in the cave, he heard someone crying.

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,977
"That's the Tang Monk," thought Wukong.

14
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:17,280
The monkey found his master tied up in a dark room.

15
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:20,175
"Master!" cried Wukong.

16
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:22,907
He landed on the monk's shoulder.

17
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:26,685
"Wukong?" asked the Tang Monk, looking around.

18
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,739
"Where are you?"

19
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,382
"I'm on your shoulder," said Wukong.

20
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,395
"I turned myself into a mosquito."

21
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:37,370
"You must save me," said the Tang Monk.

22
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:41,878
He started to cry again.

23
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,437
"Stop crying," said Wukong.

24
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,448
"You'll be free soon.

25
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:49,124
First I must defeat the demon king.

26
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll be back!"

27
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:57,898
Wukong flew down a tunnel and arrived in the throne room.

28
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,766
Yellow Wind was talking to some other demons.

29
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:07,438
"Your wind magic blew Sun Wukong away," said one demon.

30
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,616
Yellow Wind laughed.

31
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:15,488
"Only the bodhisattva Lingji can stop my wind magic.

32
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:17,078
Start a fire.

33
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,883
We're having a feast tonight!"

34
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:22,181
"Aha!" thought Wukong.

35
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:25,545
"The bodhisattva Lingji lives on Mount Sumeru.

36
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:29,927
I will ask him for helpâ€”quickly!"

37
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:38,651
The monkey leaped onto a cloud and raced through the sky.

38
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:44,661
When he arrived on Mount Sumeru, Lingji came out of his pagoda.

39
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:48,308
"It's nice to see you, Wukong," said Lingji.

40
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:50,667
"Would you like some tea?"

41
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:53,248
"No, thank you," said Wukong.

42
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:55,263
"I have an emergency!"

43
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:59,390
He quickly told the bodhisattva everything that had happened.

44
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:02,638
"I tried to fight the demon," said the monkey.

45
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,935
"But then he used powerful wind magic."

46
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:10,520
"I know who the great king Yellow Wind is," said Lingji.

47
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:12,726
"He's a weasel spirit.

48
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,648
Buddha asked me to keep an eye on him.

49
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:20,270
I told the spirit he could live on that mountain if he behaved."

50
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:22,086
Lingji shook his head.

51
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,942
"I guess he's not behaving anymore."

52
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:27,494
"Can you help me?" asked Wukong.

53
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:31,225
"They're going to eat the Tang Monk tonight!"

54
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:34,063
"Of course," said Lingji.

55
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:41,964
He picked up a staff and put a small object into his robe. "Let's go."

56
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:46,992
Soon they were in the sky, looking down at the cave door.

57
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,764
"Knock on the door," said Lingji.

58
00:03:49,765 --> 00:03:51,554
"Tell the demon to come out.

59
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:54,668
I'll do the rest."

60
00:03:54,669 --> 00:04:00,353
Wukong went down to the cave door and took out his iron bar.

61
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:04,914
Smash! The door turned into a pile of rubble.

62
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:10,893
Yellow Wind rushed outside and yelled, "You smashed my door!"

63
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:21,577
He took three deep breaths.

64
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:23,678
But nothing happened.

65
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,576
"Huh?" said Yellow Wind.

66
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:30,661
He looked up and saw Lingji in the sky.

67
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:35,005
The bodhisattva was holding a pearl in one hand.

68
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:38,837
"The wind-stopping pearl!" cried Yellow Wind.

69
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:41,167
The demon king ran.

70
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:46,756
Lingji threw his staff, which turned into a golden dragon.

71
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:50,462
The dragon threw Yellow Wind against some rocks.

72
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:55,392
There was a puff of smoke, and the demon turned into a yellow weasel.

73
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:58,175
Lingji picked up the weasel.

74
00:04:58,176 --> 00:05:01,042
"I'll bring him to Buddha to be punished, Wukong.

75
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:06,317
You may go find your companions. Good luck!"

76
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:12,381
Wukong ran into the cave and chased away the other demons.

77
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:16,381
Then he untied the Tang Monk.

78
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:21,040
The two of them went back out and found Bajie sleeping.

79
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:29,391
"Wake up, lazy!" shouted Wukong.
