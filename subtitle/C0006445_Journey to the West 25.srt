1
00:00:11,000 --> 85:30:11,000
The wind stopped.

2
85:31:51,000 --> 310:21:51,000
Wukong jumped to his feet and called back the little Wukongs.

3
310:23:31,000 --> 450:21:51,000
"Ugh," moaned Bajie. "I need a nap."

4
450:23:31,000 --> 514:55:11,000
"Get up!" yelled the monkey.

5
514:56:51,000 --> 655:31:51,000
"We have to save the Tang Monk before the demon king eats him!"

6
655:33:31,000 --> 717:16:51,000
Bajie rubbed his head.

7
717:18:31,000 --> 763:40:11,000
[g@"How can we save him?

8
763:41:51,000 --> 837:23:31,000
That wind was too powerful."@g]

9
837:25:11,000 --> 930:41:51,000
Wukong tapped his chin and thought.

10
930:43:31,000 --> 1209:36:51,000
"I'll sneak into the cave to see what I can find out."

11
1209:38:31,000 --> 1390:16:51,000
The monkey changed into a mosquito and squeezed [n@through a crack in the cave's door.

12
1390:18:31,000 --> 1541:38:31,000
Deep in the cave, he heard someone crying.

13
1541:40:11,000 --> 1721:35:11,000
"That's the Tang Monk," thought Wukong.

14
1721:36:51,000 --> 1841:06:51,000
The monkey found his master tied up in a dark room.

15
1841:08:31,000 --> 1921:31:51,000
[g@"Master!" cried Wukong.

16
1921:33:31,000 --> 1997:25:11,000
He landed on the monk's shoulder.@g]

17
1997:26:51,000 --> 2102:21:51,000
[g@"Wukong?" asked the Tang Monk, looking around.

18
2102:23:31,000 --> 2159:25:11,000
"Where are you?"@g]

19
2159:26:51,000 --> 2232:50:11,000
[g@"I'm on your shoulder," said Wukong.

20
2232:51:51,000 --> 2316:31:51,000
"I turned myself into a mosquito."@g]

21
2316:33:31,000 --> 2399:10:11,000
[g@"You must save me," said the Tang Monk.

22
2399:11:51,000 --> 2524:23:31,000
He started to cry again.@g]

23
2524:25:11,000 --> 2595:28:31,000
[g@"Stop crying," said Wukong.

24
2595:30:11,000 --> 2651:20:11,000
"You'll be free soon.@g]

25
2651:21:51,000 --> 2725:40:11,000
[g@First I must defeat the demon king.

26
2725:41:51,000 --> 2805:33:31,000
I'll be back!"@g]

27
2805:35:11,000 --> 2969:23:31,000
Wukong flew down a tunnel and arrived in the throne room.

28
2969:25:11,000 --> 3076:50:11,000
Yellow Wind was talking to some other demons.

29
3076:51:51,000 --> 3234:23:31,000
"Your wind magic blew Sun Wukong away," said one demon.

30
3234:25:11,000 --> 3322:40:11,000
[g@Yellow Wind laughed.

31
3322:41:51,000 --> 3458:00:11,000
"Only the bodhisattva Lingji can stop my wind magic.@g]

32
3458:01:51,000 --> 3502:10:11,000
[g@Start a fire.

33
3502:11:51,000 --> 3580:05:11,000
We're having a feast tonight!"@g]

34
3580:06:51,000 --> 3643:55:11,000
[g@"Aha!" thought Wukong.

35
3643:56:51,000 --> 3737:21:51,000
"The bodhisattva Lingji lives on Mount Sumeru.@g]

36
3737:23:31,000 --> 3859:05:11,000
I will ask him for helpâ€”quickly!"

37
3859:06:51,000 --> 4101:25:11,000
The monkey leaped onto a cloud and raced through the sky.

38
4101:26:51,000 --> 4268:21:51,000
When he arrived on Mount Sumeru, Lingji came out of his pagoda.

39
4268:23:31,000 --> 4369:40:11,000
[g@"It's nice to see you, Wukong," said Lingji.

40
4369:41:51,000 --> 4435:11:51,000
"Would you like some tea?"@g]

41
4435:13:31,000 --> 4506:53:31,000
[g@"No, thank you," said Wukong.

42
4506:55:11,000 --> 4562:51:51,000
"I have an emergency!"@g]

43
4562:53:31,000 --> 4677:30:11,000
He quickly told the bodhisattva everything that had happened.

44
4677:31:51,000 --> 4767:43:31,000
"I tried to fight the demon," said the monkey.

45
4767:45:11,000 --> 4859:18:31,000
"But then he used powerful wind magic."

46
4859:20:11,000 --> 4986:40:11,000
"I know who the great king Yellow Wind is," said Lingji.

47
4986:41:51,000 --> 5047:56:51,000
[g@"He's a weasel spirit.

48
5047:58:31,000 --> 5129:06:51,000
Buddha asked me to keep an eye on him.@g]

49
5129:08:31,000 --> 5257:30:11,000
I told the spirit he could live on that mountain if he behaved."

50
5257:31:51,000 --> 5307:56:51,000
[g@Lingji shook his head.

51
5307:58:31,000 --> 5387:16:51,000
"I guess he's not behaving anymore."@g]

52
5387:18:31,000 --> 5458:10:11,000
"Can you help me?" asked Wukong.

53
5458:11:51,000 --> 5561:48:31,000
"They're going to eat the Tang Monk tonight!"

54
5561:50:11,000 --> 5640:38:31,000
"Of course," said Lingji.

55
5640:40:11,000 --> 5860:06:51,000
He picked up a staff and put a small object into his robe. "Let's go."

56
5860:08:31,000 --> 5999:46:51,000
Soon they were in the sky, looking down at the cave door.

57
5999:48:31,000 --> 6076:46:51,000
"Knock on the door," said Lingji.

58
6076:48:31,000 --> 6126:30:11,000
[g@"Tell the demon to come out.

59
6126:31:51,000 --> 6213:00:11,000
I'll do the rest."@g]

60
6213:01:51,000 --> 6370:55:11,000
Wukong went down to the cave door and took out his iron bar.

61
6370:56:51,000 --> 6497:36:51,000
[i@Smash!@i] The door turned into a pile of rubble.

62
6497:38:31,000 --> 6663:41:51,000
Yellow Wind rushed outside and yelled, "You smashed my door!"

63
6663:43:31,000 --> 6960:28:31,000
[g@He took three deep breaths.

64
6960:30:11,000 --> 7018:50:11,000
But nothing happened.@g]

65
7018:51:51,000 --> 7099:20:11,000
"Huh?" said Yellow Wind.

66
7099:21:51,000 --> 7212:48:31,000
He looked up and saw Lingji in the sky.

67
7212:50:11,000 --> 7333:28:31,000
The bodhisattva was holding a pearl in one hand.

68
7333:30:11,000 --> 7439:55:11,000
"The wind-stopping pearl!" cried Yellow Wind.

69
7439:56:51,000 --> 7504:38:31,000
The demon king ran.

70
7504:40:11,000 --> 7659:53:31,000
Lingji threw his staff, which turned into a golden dragon.

71
7659:55:11,000 --> 7762:50:11,000
The dragon threw Yellow Wind against some rocks.

72
7762:51:51,000 --> 7899:46:51,000
There was a puff of smoke, and the demon turned into a yellow weasel.

73
7899:48:31,000 --> 7977:05:11,000
Lingji picked up the weasel.

74
7977:06:51,000 --> 8056:43:31,000
"I'll bring him to Buddha to be punished, Wukong.

75
8056:45:11,000 --> 8203:15:11,000
You may go find your companions. Good luck!"

76
8203:16:51,000 --> 8371:41:51,000
Wukong ran into the cave and chased away the other demons.

77
8371:43:31,000 --> 8482:48:31,000
Then he untied the Tang Monk.

78
8482:50:11,000 --> 8612:13:31,000
The two of them went back out and found Bajie sleeping.

79
8612:15:11,000 --> 8844:11:51,000
"Wake up, lazy!" shouted Wukong.
