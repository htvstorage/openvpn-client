The two Wukongs stared at Curious Ear.

2
115:10:10,933.3330000042915 --> 254:26:50,933.3329999446869
"I'm the real Wukong!" shouted one monkey. "Right?"

3
254:28:30,933.3329999446869 --> 356:55:10,933.3329999446869
"No, it's me!" shouted the other monkey.

4
356:56:50,933.3329999446869 --> 513:45:10,933.3329999446869
"I know which of you is the fake Sun Wukong," said Curious Ear.

5
513:46:50,933.3329999446869 --> 609:15:10,933.3330001831055
"But I won't say who it is.

6
609:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 769:38:30,933.3330001831055
The fake Sun Wukong has all the same powers as the real one.

7
769:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 870:06:50,933.3330001831055
[g@If I point him out, he'll be angry.

8
870:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 956:10:10,933.3330001831055
He could destroy the entire palace."@g]

9
956:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1034:08:30,933.3330001831055
"It's true," said one Wukong.

10
1034:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1137:20:10,933.3330001831055
"I could destroy this whole palace if I wanted to."

11
1137:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1251:08:30,933.3330001831055
"You mean, I could destroy it," said the other Wukong.

12
1251:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1376:00:10,933.3330001831055
"No!" yelled the other. "I could!"

13
1376:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1550:36:50,933.3330001831055
The two Wukongs began swinging their iron bars at each other.

14
1550:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1649:00:10,933.3330001831055
"Please stop!" cried the Judge of the Dead.

15
1649:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1751:01:50,933.3330001831055
"You'll tear this whole palace down!"

16
1751:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1858:35:10,933.3330001831055
The monkeys stopped.

17
1858:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1962:33:30,933.3330001831055
"Buddha can help you," said Curious Ear.

18
1962:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2070:13:30,933.3330001831055
"He'll be able to see which of you is the real Wukong.

19
2070:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2192:53:30,933.3330001831055
And he's powerful enough to destroy the fake one."

20
2192:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2341:06:50,933.3330001831055
"Of course!" cried one Wukong. "We'll go see Buddha!"

21
2341:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2453:13:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Oh, um, sure," said the other Wukong.

22
2453:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2499:05:10,933.3330001831055
He looked worried.@g]

23
2499:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2575:45:10,933.3330001831055
"You're nervous!" said the first Wukong.

24
2575:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2698:41:50,933.3330001831055
"That's because you know Buddha is going to see who you really are."

25
2698:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2782:16:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"No!" shouted the other Wukong.

26
2782:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2892:28:30,933.3330001831055
He swung his iron bar furiously.@g]

27
2892:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2982:21:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Get out!" cried the Judge of the Dead.

28
2982:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3132:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Take your fight somewhere else!"@g]

29
3132:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3238:45:10,933.3330001831055
The two Wukongs left the Land of Darkness.

30
3238:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3456:25:10,933.3330001831055
Clouds swirled and thunder boomed as the two mighty [n@spirits battled across the sky.

31
3456:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3559:03:30,933.3330001831055
They soon arrived in the Western Paradise.

32
3559:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3668:21:50,933.3330001831055
A guard rushed out of the Thunderclap Monastery.

33
3668:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3765:40:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Stop fighting immediately!" he called up to them.

34
3765:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3836:18:30,933.3330001831055
"Tell me who you are!"@g]

35
3836:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3942:31:50,933.3330001831055
The two Wukongs landed in front of the guard.

36
3942:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4001:30:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The guard looked surprised.

37
4001:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4125:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Wukong?" he said. "There are two of you!"@g]

38
4125:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4204:45:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Yes," said one of the Wukongs.

39
4204:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4282:20:10,933.3330001831055
"I must speak with Buddha right away."@g]

40
4282:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4367:41:50,933.3330001831055
The other Wukong scratched his head.

41
4367:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4465:08:30,933.3330001831055
"If Buddha is busy, we can just come back another time."

42
4465:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4539:05:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The first Wukong shot a look at the other.

43
4539:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4676:15:10,933.3330001831055
"No, we can't."@g]

44
4676:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4744:40:10,933.3330001831055
"You may enter," said the guard.

45
4744:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4846:41:50,933.3330001831055
"But you must behave yourselves while inside."

46
4846:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5028:21:50,933.3330001831055
As the first Wukong started to enter the monastery, [n@the other one backed away.

47
5028:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5132:43:30,933.3330001831055
"You're coming with me!" said the first Wukong.

48
5132:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5299:38:30,933.3330001831055
He grabbed the other monkey by the arm and dragged him into the monastery.

49
5299:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5412:35:10,933.3330001831055
In front of Buddha, the first Wukong bowed.

50
5412:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5540:15:10,933.3330001831055
The other Wukong hesitated a moment and then bowed also.

51
5540:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5622:58:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Greetings, Buddha," said the first Wukong.

52
5623:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5697:13:30,933.3330001831055
"I must ask for your help."@g]

53
5697:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5827:36:50,933.3330001831055
"I know why you're here, Wukong," said Buddha.

54
5827:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5895:36:50,933.3330001831055
[g@He looked at the other monkey.

55
5895:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6029:43:30,933.3330001831055
"And I know that [i@you@i] are a fake."@g]

56
6029:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6132:16:50,933.3330001831055
The other Wukong gasped and then vanished.

57
6132:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6308:18:30,933.3330001831055
Buddha held a bowl up in the air and then placed it upside down on a table.

58
6308:20:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6445:46:50,933.3330001831055
"I've trapped the fake Wukong under this bowl," said Buddha.

59
6445:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6582:45:10,933.3330001831055
When Buddha lifted the bowl, a tiny monkey spirit lay on the table.

60
6582:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6669:58:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong leaned closer to see.

61
6670:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6789:15:10,933.3330001831055
"He was a monkey who became an evil spirit," said Buddha.

62
6789:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6906:58:30,933.3330001831055
"He wanted to be you because you're so powerful."

63
6907:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6984:08:30,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong laughed.

64
6984:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7074:08:30,933.3330001831055
"Many spirits want to be me."@g]

65
7074:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7266:31:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey thanked Buddha and then flew back to Mount Potalaka.

66
7266:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7440:48:30,933.3330001831055
Guanyin decided it was time for Wukong to rejoin [n@his companions on the journey.

67
7440:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7628:41:50,933.3330001831055
She and the monkey found the Tang Monk and the [n@others along the road to the west.

68
7628:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7792:26:50,933.3330001831055
The bodhisattva told the Tang Monk that it wasn't Wukong who'd attacked him.

69
7792:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7919:46:50,933.3330001831055
"You must keep Wukong with you," explained Guanyin.

70
7919:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8040:53:30,933.3330001831055
"Yes, Bodhisattva," said the Tang Monk, bowing.

71
8040:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8127:51:50,933.3330001831055
"Thank you, Bodhisattva," said Wukong.

72
8127:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8403:36:50,933.3330001831055
"I'll make sure the Tang Monk reaches the Western Paradise!"
