1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:15,078
The two Wukongs stared at Curious Ear.

2
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:20,093
"I'm the real Wukong!" shouted one monkey. "Right?"

3
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:23,782
"No, it's me!" shouted the other monkey.

4
00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:29,428
"I know which of you is the fake Sun Wukong," said Curious Ear.

5
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,866
"But I won't say who it is.

6
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:38,640
The fake Sun Wukong has all the same powers as the real one.

7
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:42,257
If I point him out, he'll be angry.

8
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:45,355
He could destroy the entire palace."

9
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:48,162
"It's true," said one Wukong.

10
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:51,877
"I could destroy this whole palace if I wanted to."

11
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:55,974
"You mean, I could destroy it," said the other Wukong.

12
00:00:55,975 --> 00:01:00,469
"No!" yelled the other. "I could!"

13
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:06,755
The two Wukongs began swinging their iron bars at each other.

14
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:10,297
"Please stop!" cried the Judge of the Dead.

15
00:01:10,298 --> 00:01:13,970
"You'll tear this whole palace down!"

16
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:17,842
The monkeys stopped.

17
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:21,585
"Buddha can help you," said Curious Ear.

18
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:25,461
"He'll be able to see which of you is the real Wukong.

19
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:29,877
And he's powerful enough to destroy the fake one."

20
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:35,213
"Of course!" cried one Wukong. "We'll go see Buddha!"

21
00:01:35,214 --> 00:01:39,249
"Oh, um, sure," said the other Wukong.

22
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,900
He looked worried.

23
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,660
"You're nervous!" said the first Wukong.

24
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:48,086
"That's because you know Buddha is going to see who you really are."

25
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:51,095
"No!" shouted the other Wukong.

26
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:55,062
He swung his iron bar furiously.

27
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:58,298
"Get out!" cried the Judge of the Dead.

28
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:03,703
"Take your fight somewhere else!"

29
00:02:03,704 --> 00:02:07,528
The two Wukongs left the Land of Darkness.

30
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:15,364
Clouds swirled and thunder boomed as the two mighty spirits battled across the sky.

31
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:19,059
They soon arrived in the Western Paradise.

32
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,994
A guard rushed out of the Thunderclap Monastery.

33
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:26,497
"Stop fighting immediately!" he called up to them.

34
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:29,040
"Tell me who you are!"

35
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,864
The two Wukongs landed in front of the guard.

36
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,987
The guard looked surprised.

37
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:39,451
"Wukong?" he said. "There are two of you!"

38
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:42,304
"Yes," said one of the Wukongs.

39
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:45,097
"I must speak with Buddha right away."

40
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,170
The other Wukong scratched his head.

41
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:51,678
"If Buddha is busy, we can just come back another time."

42
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:54,340
The first Wukong shot a look at the other.

43
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:59,278
"No, we can't."

44
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,741
"You may enter," said the guard.

45
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:05,414
"But you must behave yourselves while inside."

46
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:11,954
As the first Wukong started to enter the monastery, the other one backed away.

47
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:15,711
"You're coming with me!" said the first Wukong.

48
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:21,720
He grabbed the other monkey by the arm and dragged him into the monastery.

49
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:25,786
In front of Buddha, the first Wukong bowed.

50
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:30,382
The other Wukong hesitated a moment and then bowed also.

51
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:33,360
"Greetings, Buddha," said the first Wukong.

52
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:36,033
"I must ask for your help."

53
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:40,727
"I know why you're here, Wukong," said Buddha.

54
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:43,175
He looked at the other monkey.

55
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:48,003
"And I know that you are a fake."

56
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:51,695
The other Wukong gasped and then vanished.

57
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:58,032
Buddha held a bowl up in the air and then placed it upside down on a table.

58
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:02,981
"I've trapped the fake Wukong under this bowl," said Buddha.

59
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:07,912
When Buddha lifted the bowl, a tiny monkey spirit lay on the table.

60
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:11,052
Wukong leaned closer to see.

61
00:04:11,053 --> 00:04:15,346
"He was a monkey who became an evil spirit," said Buddha.

62
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:19,584
"He wanted to be you because you're so powerful."

63
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:22,362
Wukong laughed.

64
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:25,602
"Many spirits want to be me."

65
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:32,528
The monkey thanked Buddha and then flew back to Mount Potalaka.

66
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:38,802
Guanyin decided it was time for Wukong to rejoin his companions on the journey.

67
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:45,566
She and the monkey found the Tang Monk and the others along the road to the west.

68
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:51,461
The bodhisattva told the Tang Monk that it wasn't Wukong who'd attacked him.

69
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:56,045
"You must keep Wukong with you," explained Guanyin.

70
00:04:56,046 --> 00:05:00,405
"Yes, Bodhisattva," said the Tang Monk, bowing.

71
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:03,536
"Thank you, Bodhisattva," said Wukong.

72
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:13,463
"I'll make sure the Tang Monk reaches the Western Paradise!"
