1
00:00:11,000 --> 172:00:11,000
Wukong led the monks to his companions.

2
172:01:51,000 --> 296:48:31,000
The monks told the Tang Monk everything that they had told Wukong.

3
296:50:11,000 --> 367:00:11,000
[g@"That's terrible," said the Tang Monk.

4
367:01:51,000 --> 412:43:31,000
"We must help you."@g]

5
412:45:11,000 --> 478:13:31,000
"Yes," the monkey agreed.

6
478:15:11,000 --> 568:41:51,000
"I'll deal with the Tiger Immortal in the morning."

7
568:43:31,000 --> 696:41:51,000
The monks knew of an empty building nearby.

8
696:43:31,000 --> 844:20:11,000
They led the travelers there, and everyone went to sleep for the night.

9
844:21:51,000 --> 955:16:51,000
The next morning Wukong woke up early.

10
955:18:31,000 --> 1041:43:31,000
Someone was pounding on the door of the building.

11
1041:45:11,000 --> 1154:53:31,000
A voice boomed, "I am the Tiger Immortal!"

12
1154:55:11,000 --> 1260:31:51,000
The Tang Monk's eyes popped open.

13
1260:33:31,000 --> 1346:20:11,000
He and all the other monks trembled with fear.

14
1346:21:51,000 --> 1434:56:51,000
Wujing and Bajie drew their weapons.

15
1434:58:31,000 --> 1547:26:51,000
[g@Wukong smiled. "Don't worry, everyone.

16
1547:28:31,000 --> 1636:08:31,000
I'll deal with this villain."@g]

17
1636:10:11,000 --> 1773:16:51,000
The monkey went outside.

18
1773:18:31,000 --> 1874:23:31,000
"Who are you?" demanded the Tiger Immortal.

19
1874:25:11,000 --> 1963:31:51,000
"I am Sun Wukong," said the monkey.

20
1963:33:31,000 --> 2043:20:11,000
"And you should be ashamed of yourself!

21
2043:21:51,000 --> 2199:26:51,000
Just because you're a little powerful, you think you [n@can treat the Buddhist monks badly."

22
2199:28:31,000 --> 2319:10:11,000
"A little powerful?" The Tiger Immortal looked offended.

23
2319:11:51,000 --> 2415:56:51,000
"I am [i@very@i] powerful!"

24
2415:58:31,000 --> 2541:20:11,000
Wukong laughed. "You're not as powerful as I am.

25
2541:21:51,000 --> 2649:11:51,000
Did you know that the Jade Emperor is afraid of me?

26
2649:13:31,000 --> 2737:16:51,000
I once defeated his entire army."

27
2737:18:31,000 --> 2824:03:31,000
The Tiger Immortal puffed out his chest.

28
2824:05:11,000 --> 2910:33:31,000
[g@"I can summon rain," he said.

29
2910:35:11,000 --> 2977:25:11,000
"I doubt you can do that."@g]

30
2977:26:51,000 --> 3117:40:11,000
Wukong snorted. "I can summon rain. It's easy."

31
3117:41:51,000 --> 3254:28:31,000
"Well then, let's have a contest," said the Tiger Immortal.

32
3254:30:11,000 --> 3335:35:11,000
"Whoever summons more rain is the winner.

33
3335:36:51,000 --> 3454:03:31,000
If you win, I'll let you and all the monks go free.

34
3454:05:11,000 --> 3608:03:31,000
But if I win, you must stay here and be my slaves."

35
3608:05:11,000 --> 3677:43:31,000
[g@"You're a fool," said Wukong.

36
3677:45:11,000 --> 3783:26:51,000
"I accept your challenge."@g]

37
3783:28:31,000 --> 3897:40:11,000
The Tiger Immortal led everyone into town.

38
3897:41:51,000 --> 3995:15:11,000
In the center of town was a Daoist altar.

39
3995:16:51,000 --> 4154:53:31,000
A stone tablet, incense sticks, and papers with [n@magic writing were on the altar.

40
4154:55:11,000 --> 4280:11:51,000
A crowd of people arrived to see what was going on.

41
4280:13:31,000 --> 4387:10:11,000
"I will go first," announced the Tiger Immortal.

42
4387:11:51,000 --> 4460:26:51,000
He walked toward the altar.

43
4460:28:31,000 --> 4524:03:31,000
[g@The Tang Monk shook his head.

44
4524:05:11,000 --> 4595:35:11,000
"This is terrible," he muttered.@g]

45
4595:36:51,000 --> 4664:40:11,000
Bajie glanced at him.

46
4664:41:51,000 --> 4702:40:11,000
[g@"Don't worry, Master.

47
4702:41:51,000 --> 4776:45:11,000
Wukong will win this contest."@g]

48
4776:46:51,000 --> 4864:08:31,000
"But what if he doesn't win?" asked the monk.

49
4864:10:11,000 --> 4992:31:51,000
"We'll all be stuck here, forced to work for the Tiger Immortal.

50
4992:33:31,000 --> 5101:35:11,000
If that happens, we'll never reach the Western Paradise.

51
5101:36:51,000 --> 5204:01:51,000
The True Scriptures will never get to the Tang Empire."

52
5204:03:31,000 --> 5294:25:11,000
The monk buried his face in his hands.

53
5294:26:51,000 --> 5380:23:31,000
[g@"Bajie is right, Master," said Wujing.

54
5380:25:11,000 --> 5456:05:11,000
"We have nothing to worry about."@g]

55
5456:06:51,000 --> 5537:40:11,000
Wukong stood by them, smiling.

56
5537:41:51,000 --> 5798:00:11,000
From the altar the Tiger Immortal called out, [n@"I will now pray to Heaven for rain!"

57
5798:01:51,000 --> 5937:21:51,000
The Tiger Immortal lit the incense and then sat down.

58
5937:23:31,000 --> 6070:43:31,000
He closed his eyes and began to recite a spell.

59
6070:45:11,000 --> 6186:18:31,000
Next he lit one of the papers on fire.

60
6186:20:11,000 --> 6341:51:51,000
When that one went out, he lit another paper.

61
6341:53:31,000 --> 6454:43:31,000
Soon all of the papers were gone.

62
6454:45:11,000 --> 6638:30:11,000
The Tiger Immortal lifted the stone tablet and then slammed it down. [i@Bam!@i]

63
6638:31:51,000 --> 6707:03:31,000
There was a gasp from the crowd.

64
6707:05:11,000 --> 6826:46:51,000
Wukong looked up at the sky, which was becoming dark.

65
6826:48:31,000 --> 6983:08:31,000
Wind blew and dark clouds moved in. Thunder rumbled.

66
6983:10:11,000 --> 7054:33:31,000
[g@The Tang Monk trembled. "Oh no!

67
7054:35:11,000 --> 7131:00:11,000
It's working! It's going to rain!"@g]

68
7131:01:51,000 --> 7217:35:11,000
[g@Wukong chuckled. "You all wait here.

69
7217:36:51,000 --> 7262:11:51,000
I'll be right back."@g]

70
7262:13:31,000 --> 7457:25:11,000
The monkey recited a quick spell and then left his body.

71
7457:26:51,000 --> 7611:55:11,000
Up in the sky, he found the Old Woman of the Wind fanning the clouds.

72
7611:56:51,000 --> 7722:38:31,000
The Dragon King of the Eastern Sea was approaching.

73
7722:40:11,000 --> 7815:18:31,000
[g@Wukong called out, "Stop what you're doing!

74
7815:20:11,000 --> 8003:36:51,000
Don't make any rain!"@g]
