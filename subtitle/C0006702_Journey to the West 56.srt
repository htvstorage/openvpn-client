1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,192
Wukong led the monks to his companions.

2
00:00:17,193 --> 00:00:21,685
The monks told the Tang Monk everything that they had told Wukong.

3
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:24,212
"That's terrible," said the Tang Monk.

4
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:25,858
"We must help you."

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,216
"Yes," the monkey agreed.

6
00:00:28,217 --> 00:00:31,473
"I'll deal with the Tiger Immortal in the morning."

7
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:36,081
The monks knew of an empty building nearby.

8
00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:41,396
They led the travelers there, and everyone went to sleep for the night.

9
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:45,390
The next morning Wukong woke up early.

10
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:48,502
Someone was pounding on the door of the building.

11
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:52,576
A voice boomed, "I am the Tiger Immortal!"

12
00:00:52,577 --> 00:00:56,379
The Tang Monk's eyes popped open.

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,468
He and all the other monks trembled with fear.

14
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:02,658
Wujing and Bajie drew their weapons.

15
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:06,708
Wukong smiled. "Don't worry, everyone.

16
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:09,901
I'll deal with this villain."

17
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:14,838
The monkey went outside.

18
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:18,478
"Who are you?" demanded the Tiger Immortal.

19
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,687
"I am Sun Wukong," said the monkey.

20
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:24,560
"And you should be ashamed of yourself!

21
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:30,180
Just because you're a little powerful, you think you can treat the Buddhist monks badly."

22
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:34,490
"A little powerful?" The Tiger Immortal looked offended.

23
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:37,974
"I am very powerful!"

24
00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:42,488
Wukong laughed. "You're not as powerful as I am.

25
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:46,371
Did you know that the Jade Emperor is afraid of me?

26
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,542
I once defeated his entire army."

27
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,666
The Tiger Immortal puffed out his chest.

28
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:55,780
"I can summon rain," he said.

29
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:58,187
"I doubt you can do that."

30
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:03,236
Wukong snorted. "I can summon rain. It's easy."

31
00:02:03,237 --> 00:02:08,161
"Well then, let's have a contest," said the Tiger Immortal.

32
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:11,081
"Whoever summons more rain is the winner.

33
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:15,346
If you win, I'll let you and all the monks go free.

34
00:02:15,347 --> 00:02:20,890
But if I win, you must stay here and be my slaves."

35
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,398
"You're a fool," said Wukong.

36
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:27,204
"I accept your challenge."

37
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:31,316
The Tiger Immortal led everyone into town.

38
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,829
In the center of town was a Daoist altar.

39
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,576
A stone tablet, incense sticks, and papers with magic writing were on the altar.

40
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:45,087
A crowd of people arrived to see what was going on.

41
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:48,938
"I will go first," announced the Tiger Immortal.

42
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,576
He walked toward the altar.

43
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:53,866
The Tang Monk shook his head.

44
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:56,441
"This is terrible," he muttered.

45
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,928
Bajie glanced at him.

46
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,296
"Don't worry, Master.

47
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:02,963
Wukong will win this contest."

48
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:06,109
"But what if he doesn't win?" asked the monk.

49
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,731
"We'll all be stuck here, forced to work for the Tiger Immortal.

50
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,657
If that happens, we'll never reach the Western Paradise.

51
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:18,345
The True Scriptures will never get to the Tang Empire."

52
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:21,599
The monk buried his face in his hands.

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,694
"Bajie is right, Master," said Wujing.

54
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:27,419
"We have nothing to worry about."

55
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,356
Wukong stood by them, smiling.

56
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:39,728
From the altar the Tiger Immortal called out, "I will now pray to Heaven for rain!"

57
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:44,745
The Tiger Immortal lit the incense and then sat down.

58
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:49,546
He closed his eyes and began to recite a spell.

59
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:53,707
Next he lit one of the papers on fire.

60
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:59,307
When that one went out, he lit another paper.

61
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:03,370
Soon all of the papers were gone.

62
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:09,986
The Tiger Immortal lifted the stone tablet and then slammed it down. Bam!

63
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:12,454
There was a gasp from the crowd.

64
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:16,764
Wukong looked up at the sky, which was becoming dark.

65
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:22,393
Wind blew and dark clouds moved in. Thunder rumbled.

66
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:24,964
The Tang Monk trembled. "Oh no!

67
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,716
It's working! It's going to rain!"

68
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:30,833
Wukong chuckled. "You all wait here.

69
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,439
I'll be right back."

70
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:39,467
The monkey recited a quick spell and then left his body.

71
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:45,029
Up in the sky, he found the Old Woman of the Wind fanning the clouds.

72
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,015
The Dragon King of the Eastern Sea was approaching.

73
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:52,351
Wukong called out, "Stop what you're doing!

74
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:59,130
Don't make any rain!"
