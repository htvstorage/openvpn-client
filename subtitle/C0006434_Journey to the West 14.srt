00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 106:03:30,933.3330000042915
The Tang Monk trembled with fear.

2
106:05:10,933.3330000042915 --> 167:40:10,933.3329999446869
[g@The angry voice spoke again.

167:41:50,933.3329999446869 --> 262:33:30,933.3329999446869
"Who is walking on my mountain?"@g]

4
262:35:10,933.3329999446869 --> 333:21:50,933.3329999446869
"Ahh!" cried the Tang Monk.

5
333:23:30,933.3329999446869 --> 532:16:50,933.3329999446869
He fell off his horse and tumbled down the mountain.

6
532:18:30,933.3329999446869 --> 668:46:50,933.3330001831055
At the bottom he saw a crack between the rocks.

7
668:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 847:51:50,933.3330001831055
The monk looked in and saw a moss-covered monkey peering out at him.

8
847:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 942:33:30,933.3330001831055
"My name is Sun Wukong," said the monkey.

9
942:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1045:46:50,933.3330001831055
"I am king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain."

10
1045:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1128:55:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"Why are you in there?" asked the Tang Monk.

11
1128:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1193:31:50,933.3330001831055
He stood up.@g]

1193:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1271:30:10,933.3330001831055
"Buddha put me here," said Wukong.

13
1271:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1357:56:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"I am being punished for causing trouble in Heaven.

1357:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1407:40:10,933.3330001831055
Who are you?"@g]

15
1407:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1492:48:30,933.3330001831055
"I'm just a monk," said the Tang Monk.

16
1492:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1602:15:10,933.3330001831055
"I'm going to the Western Paradise to get scriptures from Buddha."

17
1602:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1734:25:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong gasped. "You're the Tang Monk!" he cried.

18
1734:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1813:05:10,933.3330001831055
"I'm supposed to go with you!"

19
1813:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 1898:16:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk took a step back.

1898:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2006:38:30,933.3330001831055
Was this strange monkey telling the truth?@g]

21
2006:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2128:03:30,933.3330001831055
"The bodhisattva Guanyin visited me," Wukong went on.

22
2128:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2248:26:50,933.3330001831055
"She said I'd be set free if I promise to protect you on the journey.

23
2248:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2339:31:50,933.3330001831055
Set me free, and I'll go with you to the West."

24
2339:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2414:50:10,933.3330001831055
[g@The Tang Monk relaxed.

25
2414:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2471:58:30,933.3330001831055
He looked at the rocks.@g]

26
2472:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2524:38:30,933.3330001831055
"How can I free you?"

27
2524:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2646:31:50,933.3330001831055
"There's a small piece of paper on top of this mountain," said Wukong.

28
2646:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2813:23:30,933.3330001831055
"You must remove it."

29
2813:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2903:50:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk went back up the mountain.

30
2903:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3212:10:10,933.3330001831055
He pushed aside shrubs and brambles and pulled himself over large boulders.

31
3212:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3453:10:10,933.3330001831055
Finally he reached the mountain's peak.

32
3453:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3523:21:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The monk picked up the paper.

33
3523:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3641:43:30,933.3330001831055
Right away a breeze swept it from his hand.@g]

34
3641:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3774:10:10,933.3330001831055
The paper floated up and then disappeared among the clouds.

35
3774:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3900:01:50,933.3330001831055
The monk hurried back down the mountain.

36
3900:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4008:30:10,933.3330001831055
"The paper floated away," he said to the monkey.

37
4008:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4082:40:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"It returned to Buddha," said Wukong.

38
4082:41:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4129:16:50,933.3330001831055
"Now step back."@g]

39
4129:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4244:36:50,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk took a step back.

40
4244:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4324:35:10,933.3330001831055
"Go farther," said Wukong.

41
4324:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4399:38:30,933.3330001831055
The monk took another step back.

42
4399:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4546:48:30,933.3330001831055
"Go farther," said Wukong again.

43
4546:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4658:35:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk went far from the mountain.

44
4658:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4798:26:50,933.3330001831055
He gasped as the entire mountain rose into the air.

45
4798:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4954:15:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong stood under the mountain, holding it up with his hands.

46
4954:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5173:21:50,933.3330001831055
He jumped out, and the mountain crashed down behind him.

47
5173:23:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5263:50:10,933.3330001831055
Wukong grabbed the Tang Monk's hands.

48
5263:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5412:55:10,933.3330001831055
"Thank you, Master! I will help you reach the Western Paradise."

49
5412:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5517:23:30,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk rode the horse as Wukong walked.

50
5517:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5594:00:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey told the monk about himself.

51
5594:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5749:53:30,933.3330001831055
"The Jade Emperor's entire army couldn't defeat me." He laughed.

52
5749:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5841:36:50,933.3330001831055
"So I said [i@I@i] should be in charge of Heaven."

53
5841:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5943:51:50,933.3330001831055
"What powers do you have?" asked the Tang Monk.

54
5943:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6120:13:30,933.3330001831055
"I can become other animals," said Wukong. "Watch this!"

55
6120:15:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6196:10:10,933.3330001831055
[g@He quickly changed into a tiger.

6196:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6253:50:10,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk gulped.@g]

57
6253:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6408:08:30,933.3330001831055
Wukong changed into a snake, a vulture, and then back into himself.

58
6408:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6467:35:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"And that's not all," he said.

59
6467:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6585:48:30,933.3330001831055
"I can grow big!"@g]

60
6585:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6727:06:50,933.3330001831055
The monkey's body grew so big that his head reached the clouds.

61
6727:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6829:46:50,933.3330001831055
"And I can become tiny!" said Wukong.

62
6829:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6959:45:10,933.3330001831055
He shrank to the size of a bee and hopped onto the monk's head.

63
6959:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7055:53:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"I can do more!" said Wukong.

64
7055:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7146:48:30,933.3330001831055
He changed back to his normal size.@g]

65
7146:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7285:20:10,933.3330001831055
His iron bar appeared from his ear.

66
7285:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7417:55:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey spun it around and then struck a huge boulder.

67
7417:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7577:56:50,933.3330001831055
[i@Smash!@i] The boulder exploded into tiny pieces.

68
7577:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7667:36:50,933.3330001831055
The Tang Monk watched in horror.

69
7667:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7786:11:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong laughed. "Don't look so scared, Master.

7869:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8016:35:10,933.3330001831055
The two traveled farther until they saw a group of men blocking the road.

72
8016:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8076:33:30,933.3330001831055
[g@The men looked rough and mean.

73
8076:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8151:30:10,933.3330001831055
They all had weapons.@g]

74
8151:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8263:25:10,933.3330001831055
One man stepped forward and waved a sword.

75
8263:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8495:36:50,933.3330001831055
"Give us your money, or you'll be sorry!"
