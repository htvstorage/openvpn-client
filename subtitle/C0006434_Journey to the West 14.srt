1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:14,751
The Tang Monk trembled with fear.

2
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:16,969
The angry voice spoke again.

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,385
"Who is walking on my mountain?"

4
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:22,934
"Ahh!" cried the Tang Monk.

5
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:30,095
He fell off his horse and tumbled down the mountain.

6
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:35,009
At the bottom he saw a crack between the rocks.

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,456
The monk looked in and saw a moss-covered monkey peering out at him.

8
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:44,865
"My name is Sun Wukong," said the monkey.

9
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:48,581
"I am king of the Fruit and Flower Mountain."

10
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:51,574
"Why are you in there?" asked the Tang Monk.

11
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:53,900
He stood up.

12
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,707
"Buddha put me here," said Wukong.

13
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:59,819
"I am being punished for causing trouble in Heaven.

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,609
Who are you?"

15
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,674
"I'm just a monk," said the Tang Monk.

16
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:08,614
"I'm going to the Western Paradise to get scriptures from Buddha."

17
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:13,372
Wukong gasped. "You're the Tang Monk!" he cried.

18
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,204
"I'm supposed to go with you!"

19
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:19,271
The Tang Monk took a step back.

20
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:23,172
Was this strange monkey telling the truth?

21
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:27,543
"The bodhisattva Guanyin visited me," Wukong went on.

22
00:01:27,544 --> 00:01:31,877
"She said I'd be set free if I promise to protect you on the journey.

23
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:35,156
Set me free, and I'll go with you to the West."

24
00:01:35,157 --> 00:01:37,867
The Tang Monk relaxed.

25
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:39,924
He looked at the rocks.

26
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:41,820
"How can I free you?"

27
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:46,208
"There's a small piece of paper on top of this mountain," said Wukong.

28
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:52,215
"You must remove it."

29
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:55,471
The Tang Monk went back up the mountain.

30
00:01:55,472 --> 00:02:06,571
He pushed aside shrubs and brambles and pulled himself over large boulders.

31
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:15,247
Finally he reached the mountain's peak.

32
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:17,774
The monk picked up the paper.

33
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:22,035
Right away a breeze swept it from his hand.

34
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:26,803
The paper floated up and then disappeared among the clouds.

35
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:31,334
The monk hurried back down the mountain.

36
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:35,239
"The paper floated away," he said to the monkey.

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,909
"It returned to Buddha," said Wukong.

38
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,587
"Now step back."

39
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:43,739
The Tang Monk took a step back.

40
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,618
"Go farther," said Wukong.

41
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:49,320
The monk took another step back.

42
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:54,618
"Go farther," said Wukong again.

43
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:58,642
The Tang Monk went far from the mountain.

44
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:03,677
He gasped as the entire mountain rose into the air.

45
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:09,286
Wukong stood under the mountain, holding it up with his hands.

46
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:17,174
He jumped out, and the mountain crashed down behind him.

47
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:20,431
Wukong grabbed the Tang Monk's hands.

48
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:25,798
"Thank you, Master! I will help you reach the Western Paradise."

49
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,559
The Tang Monk rode the horse as Wukong walked.

50
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,317
The monkey told the monk about himself.

51
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,929
"The Jade Emperor's entire army couldn't defeat me." He laughed.

52
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,231
"So I said I should be in charge of Heaven."

53
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:44,912
"What powers do you have?" asked the Tang Monk.

54
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:51,261
"I can become other animals," said Wukong. "Watch this!"

55
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,995
He quickly changed into a tiger.

56
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:56,071
The Tang Monk gulped.

57
00:03:56,072 --> 00:04:01,626
Wukong changed into a snake, a vulture, and then back into himself.

58
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:03,766
"And that's not all," he said.

59
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:08,022
"I can grow big!"

60
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:13,109
The monkey's body grew so big that his head reached the clouds.

61
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,805
"And I can become tiny!" said Wukong.

62
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:21,484
He shrank to the size of a bee and hopped onto the monk's head.

63
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:24,945
"I can do more!" said Wukong.

64
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:28,218
He changed back to his normal size.

65
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:33,205
His iron bar appeared from his ear.

66
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:37,978
The monkey spun it around and then struck a huge boulder.

67
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:43,739
Smash! The boulder exploded into tiny pieces.

68
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,967
The Tang Monk watched in horror.

69
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:51,236
Wukong laughed. "Don't look so scared, Master.

70
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:54,248
I'm protecting you!"

71
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:59,530
The two traveled farther until they saw a group of men blocking the road.

72
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,689
The men looked rough and mean.

73
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,387
They all had weapons.

74
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:08,416
One man stepped forward and waved a sword.

75
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:16,775
"Give us your money, or you'll be sorry!"
