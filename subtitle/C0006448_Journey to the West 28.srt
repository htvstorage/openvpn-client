00:00:11,066.66700000000128 --> 206:36:51,066.66700005531311
Bajie looked out the kitchen window.

2
206:38:31,066.66700005531311 --> 321:03:31,066.66700005531311
Wukong and Wujing were outside talking.

3
321:05:11,066.66700005531311 --> 425:41:51,066.66700005531311
"Wukong, Wujing," said the pig quietly.

4
425:43:31,066.66700005531311 --> 465:48:31,066.66700005531311
[g@"Come over here.

5
465:50:11,066.66700005531311 --> 538:38:31,066.66700005531311
I want to tell you something."@g]

6
538:40:11,066.66700005531311 --> 650:51:51,066.66699981689453
The two companions came over to the window.

7
650:53:31,066.66699981689453 --> 726:31:51,066.66699981689453
"What is it?" asked Wujing.

8
726:33:31,066.66699981689453 --> 828:23:31,066.66699981689453
"I heard the two priests talking," said the pig.

9
828:25:11,066.66699981689453 --> 917:30:11,066.66699981689453
"There's a ginseng tree at this abbey.

10
917:31:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1019:00:11,066.66699981689453
They said its fruit is delicious and valuable."

11
1019:01:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1138:46:51,066.66699981689453
Wukong smiled. "The fruit must taste wonderful."

12
1138:48:31,066.66699981689453 --> 1213:10:11,066.66699981689453
"We should eat some," said Wujing.

13
1213:11:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1275:36:51,066.66699981689453
[g@Bajie rubbed his belly.

14
1275:38:31,066.66699981689453 --> 1375:35:11,066.66699981689453
"Yes," he said. "We should."@g]

15
1375:36:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1451:30:11,066.66699981689453
[g@"You two wait here," said Wukong.

16
1451:31:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1590:33:31,066.66699981689453
"I'll go pick some of that fruit."@g]

17
1590:35:11,066.66699981689453 --> 1714:36:51,066.66699981689453
The monkey went behind the abbey and found the giant ginseng tree.

18
1714:38:31,066.66699981689453 --> 1857:40:11,066.66699981689453
The fruit sparkled in the sunlight.

19
1857:41:51,066.66699981689453 --> 2039:21:51,066.66699981689453
He plucked three pieces from the tree's [n@branches and went back to the kitchen.

20
2039:23:31,066.66699981689453 --> 2168:08:31,066.66699981689453
He handed Bajie and Wujing each a ginseng fruit.

21
2168:10:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2269:15:11,066.66699981689453
[g@Wujing took a bite.

22
2269:16:51,066.66699981689453 --> 2344:45:11,066.66699981689453
"This fruit is delicious!"@g]

23
2344:46:51,066.66699981689453 --> 2471:45:11,066.66699981689453
"Yes," said Wukong. "It truly is."

24
2471:46:51,066.66699981689453 --> 2659:35:11,066.66699981689453
Bajie opened his mouth wide and threw his ginseng fruit in. [i@Gulp!@i]

25
2659:36:51,066.66699981689453 --> 2770:13:31,066.66699981689453
"Bajie, you should be ashamed of yourself," said Wukong.

26
2770:15:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2854:58:31,066.66699981689453
"You didn't even chew!"

27
2855:00:11,066.66699981689453 --> 3033:51:51,066.66699981689453
"I was too hungry to chew," said the pig. He groaned.

28
3033:53:31,066.66699981689453 --> 3132:26:51,066.66699981689453
"And now I wish I had another ginseng fruit.

29
3132:28:31,066.66699981689453 --> 3227:08:31,066.66699981689453
I didn't even taste that one!"

30
3227:10:11,066.66699981689453 --> 3372:46:51,066.66699981689453
At that moment the two priests were walking past the kitchen.

31
3372:48:31,066.66699981689453 --> 3463:38:31,066.66699981689453
"Did you hear what the pig said?" whispered one priest.

32
3463:40:11,066.66699981689453 --> 3575:48:31,066.66699981689453
"I think the Tang Monk's companions are eating the ginseng fruit!"

33
3575:50:11,066.66699981689453 --> 3719:26:51,066.66699981689453
The two priests ran outside and searched the ginseng tree.

34
3719:28:31,066.66699981689453 --> 3826:03:31,066.66699981689453
Three pieces of fruit were gone.

35
3826:05:11,066.66699981689453 --> 3903:06:51,066.66699981689453
"This is terrible!" said one priest.

36
3903:08:31,066.66699981689453 --> 4011:55:11,066.66699981689453
"The Great Immortal will be very upset!"

37
4011:56:51,066.66699981689453 --> 4133:03:31,066.66699981689453
They ran inside and found the Tang Monk.

38
4133:05:11,066.66699981689453 --> 4241:15:11,066.66699981689453
"Your companions are criminals!" shouted one priest.

39
4241:16:51,066.66699981689453 --> 4336:06:51,066.66699981689453
"What are you talking about?" asked the monk.

40
4336:08:31,066.66699981689453 --> 4469:28:31,066.66699981689453
"They stole some of our ginseng fruit!" said the other priest.

41
4469:30:11,066.66699981689453 --> 4609:31:51,066.66699981689453
Just then Wukong, Bajie, and Wujing walked in.

42
4609:33:31,066.66699981689453 --> 4722:05:11,066.66699981689453
"Thieves!" cried the first priest.

43
4722:06:51,066.66699981689453 --> 4832:30:11,066.66699981689453
[g@"How dare you call us thieves!" shouted Bajie.

44
4832:31:51,066.66699981689453 --> 4891:08:31,066.66699981689453
"What did we steal?"@g]

45
4891:10:11,066.66699981689453 --> 5008:23:31,066.66699981689453
"Don't pretend you don't know!" said the other priest.

46
5008:25:11,066.66699981689453 --> 5129:05:11,066.66699981689453
"You ate ginseng fruit from our master's tree!"

47
5129:06:51,066.66699981689453 --> 5317:03:31,066.66699981689453
Wujing wiped some juice from the side of his mouth. Wukong giggled.

48
5317:05:11,066.66699981689453 --> 5411:03:31,066.66699981689453
"What is so funny?" asked the other priest.

49
5411:05:11,066.66699981689453 --> 5521:45:11,066.66699981689453
[g@Wukong laughed harder and pointed at Bajie.

50
5521:46:51,066.66699981689453 --> 5593:46:51,066.66699981689453
"It was his idea!"@g]

51
5593:48:31,066.66699981689453 --> 5697:06:51,066.66699981689453
"You're the one who stole the fruit!" cried the pig.

52
5697:08:31,066.66699981689453 --> 5811:26:51,066.66699981689453
"You're all thieves and liars!" cried one of the priests.

53
5811:28:31,066.66699981689453 --> 5894:33:31,066.66699981689453
"We invited you into our abbey as guests!

54
5894:35:11,066.66699981689453 --> 5982:01:51,066.66699981689453
And you repay us by stealing from us!"

55
5982:03:31,066.66699981689453 --> 6058:48:31,066.66699981689453
The two priests yelled and yelled.

56
6058:50:11,066.66699981689453 --> 6190:06:51,066.66699981689453
They called Wukong and his companions all sorts of terrible names.

57
6190:08:31,066.66699981689453 --> 6275:45:11,066.66699981689453
"I don't want to listen to this," thought the monkey.

58
6275:46:51,066.66699981689453 --> 6402:48:31,066.66699981689453
He recited a quick spell and changed into a spirit form.

59
6402:50:11,066.66699981689453 --> 6565:06:51,066.66699981689453
He left his body standing in the room and went out behind the abbey.

60
6565:08:31,066.66699981689453 --> 6687:00:11,066.66699981689453
Wukong stood before the ginseng tree.

61
6687:01:51,066.66699981689453 --> 6794:50:11,066.66699981689453
"Those priests are rude!" he said to himself.

62
6794:51:51,066.66699981689453 --> 6880:31:51,066.66699981689453
"So what if we ate some ginseng fruit?

63
6880:33:31,066.66699981689453 --> 7010:41:51,066.66699981689453
They have no right to call us names!"

64
7010:43:31,066.66699981689453 --> 7143:56:51,066.66699981689453
Wukong grew very angry.

65
7143:58:31,066.66699981689453 --> 7282:00:11,066.66699981689453
Finally he took out his iron bar and struck the tree.

66
7282:01:51,066.66699981689453 --> 7427:30:11,066.66699981689453
There was a loud crack, and the entire tree crashed to the ground.

67
7427:31:51,066.66699981689453 --> 7577:23:31,066.66699981689453
Wukong put the iron bar back in his ear and returned to his body.

68
7577:25:11,066.66699981689453 --> 7664:25:11,066.66699981689453
The priests were still yelling.

69
7664:26:51,066.66699981689453 --> 7769:25:11,066.66699981689453
"Stop yelling!" commanded Wukong.

70
7769:26:51,066.66699981689453 --> 7886:41:51,066.66699981689453
The priests stopped yelling and looked at the monkey.

71
7886:43:31,066.66699981689453 --> 8022:23:31,066.66699981689453
"I think you made a mistake," said the monkey with a big smile.

72
8022:25:11,066.66699981689453 --> 8265:18:31,066.66699981689453
"Why don't you go outside to your ginseng tree and count the fruit again?"
