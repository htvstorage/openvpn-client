1
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:18,505
Bajie looked out the kitchen window.

2
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:22,625
Wukong and Wujing were outside talking.

3
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:26,392
"Wukong, Wujing," said the pig quietly.

4
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,836
"Come over here.

5
00:00:27,837 --> 00:00:30,458
I want to tell you something."

6
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:34,498
The two companions came over to the window.

7
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:37,222
"What is it?" asked Wujing.

8
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:40,889
"I heard the two priests talking," said the pig.

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,097
"There's a ginseng tree at this abbey.

10
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:47,751
They said its fruit is delicious and valuable."

11
00:00:47,752 --> 00:00:52,063
Wukong smiled. "The fruit must taste wonderful."

12
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:54,741
"We should eat some," said Wujing.

13
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:56,989
Bajie rubbed his belly.

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,588
"Yes," he said. "We should."

15
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:03,321
"You two wait here," said Wukong.

16
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:08,327
"I'll go pick some of that fruit."

17
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:12,793
The monkey went behind the abbey and found the giant ginseng tree.

18
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:17,943
The fruit sparkled in the sunlight.

19
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:24,484
He plucked three pieces from the tree's branches and went back to the kitchen.

20
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:29,120
He handed Bajie and Wujing each a ginseng fruit.

21
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:32,760
Wujing took a bite.

22
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:35,478
"This fruit is delicious!"

23
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,050
"Yes," said Wukong. "It truly is."

24
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:46,812
Bajie opened his mouth wide and threw his ginseng fruit in. Gulp!

25
00:01:46,813 --> 00:01:50,795
"Bajie, you should be ashamed of yourself," said Wukong.

26
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:53,846
"You didn't even chew!"

27
00:01:53,847 --> 00:02:00,286
"I was too hungry to chew," said the pig. He groaned.

28
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,835
"And now I wish I had another ginseng fruit.

29
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:07,244
I didn't even taste that one!"

30
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:12,487
At that moment the two priests were walking past the kitchen.

31
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:15,758
"Did you hear what the pig said?" whispered one priest.

32
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,796
"I think the Tang Monk's companions are eating the ginseng fruit!"

33
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:24,967
The two priests ran outside and searched the ginseng tree.

34
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:28,805
Three pieces of fruit were gone.

35
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:31,579
"This is terrible!" said one priest.

36
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,496
"The Great Immortal will be very upset!"

37
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:39,857
They ran inside and found the Tang Monk.

38
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:43,752
"Your companions are criminals!" shouted one priest.

39
00:02:43,753 --> 00:02:47,167
"What are you talking about?" asked the monk.

40
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,968
"They stole some of our ginseng fruit!" said the other priest.

41
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:57,010
Just then Wukong, Bajie, and Wujing walked in.

42
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:01,062
"Thieves!" cried the first priest.

43
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:05,037
"How dare you call us thieves!" shouted Bajie.

44
00:03:05,038 --> 00:03:07,148
"What did we steal?"

45
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:11,369
"Don't pretend you don't know!" said the other priest.

46
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,714
"You ate ginseng fruit from our master's tree!"

47
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:22,481
Wujing wiped some juice from the side of his mouth. Wukong giggled.

48
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:25,865
"What is so funny?" asked the other priest.

49
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:29,850
Wukong laughed harder and pointed at Bajie.

50
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:32,443
"It was his idea!"

51
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:36,163
"You're the one who stole the fruit!" cried the pig.

52
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:40,279
"You're all thieves and liars!" cried one of the priests.

53
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,271
"We invited you into our abbey as guests!

54
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:46,420
And you repay us by stealing from us!"

55
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,184
The two priests yelled and yelled.

56
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:53,911
They called Wukong and his companions all sorts of terrible names.

57
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:56,994
"I don't want to listen to this," thought the monkey.

58
00:03:56,995 --> 00:04:01,568
He recited a quick spell and changed into a spirit form.

59
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:07,411
He left his body standing in the room and went out behind the abbey.

60
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:11,799
Wukong stood before the ginseng tree.

61
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,681
"Those priests are rude!" he said to himself.

62
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:18,766
"So what if we ate some ginseng fruit?

63
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:23,452
They have no right to call us names!"

64
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:28,249
Wukong grew very angry.

65
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,219
Finally he took out his iron bar and struck the tree.

66
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,457
There was a loud crack, and the entire tree crashed to the ground.

67
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:43,853
Wukong put the iron bar back in his ear and returned to his body.

68
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:46,986
The priests were still yelling.

69
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:50,766
"Stop yelling!" commanded Wukong.

70
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:54,988
The priests stopped yelling and looked at the monkey.

71
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:59,873
"I think you made a mistake," said the monkey with a big smile.

72
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:08,618
"Why don't you go outside to your ginseng tree and count the fruit again?"
