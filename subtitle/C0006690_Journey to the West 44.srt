1
00:00:11,000 --> 170:08:31,000
The man walked into the Tang Monk's room.

2
170:10:11,000 --> 291:50:11,000
"Wh-who are you?" asked the Tang Monk nervously.

3
291:51:51,000 --> 411:16:51,000
"I'm king of the Black Rooster Kingdom," said the man.

4
411:18:31,000 --> 564:21:51,000
"My kingdom suffered a horrible drought five years ago.

5
564:23:31,000 --> 667:16:51,000
Crops wouldn't grow, and my people were starving.

6
667:18:31,000 --> 758:46:51,000
One day a Daoist arrived in the kingdom.

7
758:48:31,000 --> 893:53:31,000
He said he had great powers and could pray for rain."

8
893:55:11,000 --> 1009:25:11,000
"Did the Daoist's prayers bring rain?" asked the Tang Monk.

9
1009:26:51,000 --> 1053:46:51,000
[g@The king nodded.

10
1053:48:31,000 --> 1174:50:11,000
"It rained for days, and our crops began to grow."@g]

11
1174:51:51,000 --> 1264:41:51,000
[g@"Wonderful!" said the Tang Monk with a smile.

12
1264:43:31,000 --> 1342:13:31,000
But then his smile faded.@g]

13
1342:15:11,000 --> 1471:36:51,000
"I'm confused. Why do you need my help?"

14
1471:38:31,000 --> 1536:28:31,000
The king took a deep breath.

15
1536:30:11,000 --> 1662:50:11,000
"After the Daoist brought the rain, we became close friends.

16
1662:51:51,000 --> 1805:05:11,000
One day we were walking when I noticed a strange light coming from my well.

17
1805:06:51,000 --> 1874:01:51,000
[g@I went to the well and looked in.

18
1874:03:31,000 --> 2004:40:11,000
Suddenly I felt someone push me in.@g]

19
2004:41:51,000 --> 2067:53:31,000
[g@It was the Daoist!

20
2067:55:11,000 --> 2179:06:51,000
He had made the light with magic so he could trick me.@g]

21
2179:08:31,000 --> 2362:26:51,000
I fell deep into the water, and he sealed the well shut."

22
2362:28:31,000 --> 2444:36:51,000
Tears came to the king's eyes.

23
2444:38:31,000 --> 2527:10:11,000
[g@"My body is still down there.

24
2527:11:51,000 --> 2618:43:31,000
I'm just a . . . ghost."@g]

25
2618:45:11,000 --> 2693:25:11,000
"That's horrible!" said the Tang Monk.

26
2693:26:51,000 --> 2770:50:11,000
"Your guards punished the Daoist, right?"

27
2770:51:51,000 --> 2835:26:51,000
The king shook his head.

28
2835:28:31,000 --> 3020:18:31,000
"The Daoist made himself look like me, and [n@now everyone thinks he's the real king."

29
3020:20:11,000 --> 3069:25:11,000
[g@The king paused.

30
3069:26:51,000 --> 3196:50:11,000
"I've been in the Land of Darkness ever since.@g]

31
3196:51:51,000 --> 3274:41:51,000
[g@Tonight a spirit brought me to see you.

32
3274:43:31,000 --> 3352:18:31,000
He said you can help me."@g]

33
3352:20:11,000 --> 3430:21:51,000
[g@"How can I help you?" asked the Tang Monk.

34
3430:23:31,000 --> 3524:20:11,000
"I'm just a monk."@g]

35
3524:21:51,000 --> 3636:36:51,000
"Yes, but you're traveling with Sun Wukong," said the king.

36
3636:38:31,000 --> 3713:31:51,000
[g@"Sun Wukong is very powerful.

37
3713:33:31,000 --> 3790:43:31,000
He can destroy the Daoist!"@g]

38
3790:45:11,000 --> 3860:11:51,000
The Tang Monk hesitated.

39
3860:13:31,000 --> 3979:48:31,000
"Wukong can't charge into the palace and attack the Daoist.

40
3979:50:11,000 --> 4116:03:31,000
People will think the monkey is evil, attacking a king for no reason."

41
4116:05:11,000 --> 4261:48:31,000
"My son, the prince, can bring all of you into the palace," said the king.

42
4261:50:11,000 --> 4381:31:51,000
"Then Sun Wukong can fight the Daoist in private."

43
4381:33:31,000 --> 4501:01:51,000
"Where can we find the prince?" asked the monk.

44
4501:03:31,000 --> 4598:06:51,000
"He will be out hunting tomorrow," said the king.

45
4598:08:31,000 --> 4673:00:11,000
"Tell him everything I told you."

46
4673:01:51,000 --> 4751:03:31,000
"But he won't believe us," said the monk.

47
4751:05:11,000 --> 4833:08:31,000
"He thinks that Daoist is his father."

48
4833:10:11,000 --> 4882:10:11,000
[g@"Show him this."

49
4882:11:51,000 --> 4959:46:51,000
The king held up a jade coin.@g]

50
4959:48:31,000 --> 5058:45:11,000
"This is the one royal treasure I still have.

51
5058:46:51,000 --> 5154:56:51,000
When my son sees it, he'll know you're telling the truth."

52
5154:58:31,000 --> 5236:45:11,000
Suddenly the king looked at the door.

53
5236:46:51,000 --> 5285:15:11,000
[g@"The spirit is calling me.

54
5285:16:51,000 --> 5318:03:31,000
I must go."

55
5318:05:11,000 --> 5403:33:31,000
The king vanished.@g]

56
5403:35:11,000 --> 5576:40:11,000
The Tang Monk called to his companions, who rushed into the room.

57
5576:41:51,000 --> 5679:40:11,000
The monk told them everything that the king had said.

58
5679:41:51,000 --> 5769:18:31,000
"He showed me a jade coin," said the monk.

59
5769:20:11,000 --> 5811:21:51,000
[g@He looked around.

60
5811:23:31,000 --> 5894:26:51,000
"I don't know where it is now though."@g]

61
5894:28:31,000 --> 5991:58:31,000
"It was just a dream," said Wukong.

62
5992:00:11,000 --> 6186:36:51,000
"No, it wasn't a dream," said the monk, still looking around.

63
6186:38:31,000 --> 6271:40:11,000
[g@He went outside, and the others followed.

64
6271:41:51,000 --> 6312:45:11,000
"There it is!"@g]

65
6312:46:51,000 --> 6480:03:31,000
A jade coin lay on the ground by the door.

66
6480:05:11,000 --> 6639:11:51,000
The next morning the prince went out hunting.

67
6639:13:31,000 --> 6727:55:11,000
[g@He saw a white rabbit and shot an arrow.

68
6727:56:51,000 --> 6915:43:31,000
He missed and the rabbit ran.@g]

69
6915:45:11,000 --> 7020:30:11,000
The prince chased the rabbit as it ran into a monastery.

70
7020:31:51,000 --> 7174:33:31,000
Inside, the prince saw a monk, a pig, and a purple spirit.

71
7174:35:11,000 --> 7274:01:51,000
Then the rabbit turned into a monkey.

72
7274:03:31,000 --> 7359:28:31,000
"What's going on here?" cried the prince.

73
7359:30:11,000 --> 7428:13:31,000
The monk stepped forward.

74
7428:15:11,000 --> 7472:30:11,000
[g@"Don't be scared, Prince.

75
7472:31:51,000 --> 7673:28:31,000
We must tell you something."@g]
