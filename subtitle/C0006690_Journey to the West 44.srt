1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,125
The man walked into the Tang Monk's room.

2
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:21,506
"Wh-who are you?" asked the Tang Monk nervously.

3
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:25,806
"I'm king of the Black Rooster Kingdom," said the man.

4
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:31,317
"My kingdom suffered a horrible drought five years ago.

5
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:35,022
Crops wouldn't grow, and my people were starving.

6
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:38,316
One day a Daoist arrived in the kingdom.

7
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:43,180
He said he had great powers and could pray for rain."

8
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:47,339
"Did the Daoist's prayers bring rain?" asked the Tang Monk.

9
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,936
The king nodded.

10
00:00:48,937 --> 00:00:53,294
"It rained for days, and our crops began to grow."

11
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:56,529
"Wonderful!" said the Tang Monk with a smile.

12
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,320
But then his smile faded.

13
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:03,978
"I'm confused. Why do you need my help?"

14
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:06,313
The king took a deep breath.

15
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:10,862
"After the Daoist brought the rain, we became close friends.

16
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:15,983
One day we were walking when I noticed a strange light coming from my well.

17
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:18,465
I went to the well and looked in.

18
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:23,168
Suddenly I felt someone push me in.

19
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:25,444
It was the Daoist!

20
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:29,448
He had made the light with magic so he could trick me.

21
00:01:29,449 --> 00:01:36,048
I fell deep into the water, and he sealed the well shut."

22
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,006
Tears came to the king's eyes.

23
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:41,978
"My body is still down there.

24
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:45,274
I'm just a . . . ghost."

25
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:47,963
"That's horrible!" said the Tang Monk.

26
00:01:47,964 --> 00:01:50,750
"Your guards punished the Daoist, right?"

27
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,076
The king shook his head.

28
00:01:53,077 --> 00:01:59,731
"The Daoist made himself look like me, and now everyone thinks he's the real king."

29
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:01,499
The king paused.

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,086
"I've been in the Land of Darkness ever since.

31
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:08,889
Tonight a spirit brought me to see you.

32
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,683
He said you can help me."

33
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:14,493
"How can I help you?" asked the Tang Monk.

34
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:17,876
"I'm just a monk."

35
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:21,918
"Yes, but you're traveling with Sun Wukong," said the king.

36
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,687
"Sun Wukong is very powerful.

37
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:27,466
He can destroy the Daoist!"

38
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,967
The Tang Monk hesitated.

39
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:34,273
"Wukong can't charge into the palace and attack the Daoist.

40
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:39,178
People will think the monkey is evil, attacking a king for no reason."

41
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:44,425
"My son, the prince, can bring all of you into the palace," said the king.

42
00:02:44,426 --> 00:02:48,735
"Then Sun Wukong can fight the Daoist in private."

43
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:53,037
"Where can we find the prince?" asked the monk.

44
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:56,532
"He will be out hunting tomorrow," said the king.

45
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,228
"Tell him everything I told you."

46
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:02,038
"But he won't believe us," said the monk.

47
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,993
"He thinks that Daoist is his father."

48
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:06,758
"Show him this."

49
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,552
The king held up a jade coin.

50
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:13,115
"This is the one royal treasure I still have.

51
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:16,578
When my son sees it, he'll know you're telling the truth."

52
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:19,523
Suddenly the king looked at the door.

53
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,269
"The spirit is calling me.

54
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,450
I must go."

55
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:25,528
The king vanished.

56
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:31,760
The Tang Monk called to his companions, who rushed into the room.

57
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:35,468
The monk told them everything that the king had said.

58
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:38,695
"He showed me a jade coin," said the monk.

59
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:40,209
He looked around.

60
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,200
"I don't know where it is now though."

61
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:46,711
"It was just a dream," said Wukong.

62
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:53,718
"No, it wasn't a dream," said the monk, still looking around.

63
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:56,780
He went outside, and the others followed.

64
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:58,259
"There it is!"

65
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,282
A jade coin lay on the ground by the door.

66
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:10,011
The next morning the prince went out hunting.

67
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:13,205
He saw a white rabbit and shot an arrow.

68
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:19,966
He missed and the rabbit ran.

69
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:23,738
The prince chased the rabbit as it ran into a monastery.

70
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:29,284
Inside, the prince saw a monk, a pig, and a purple spirit.

71
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:32,865
Then the rabbit turned into a monkey.

72
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:35,941
"What's going on here?" cried the prince.

73
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,416
The monk stepped forward.

74
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:40,010
"Don't be scared, Prince.

75
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:47,245
We must tell you something."
