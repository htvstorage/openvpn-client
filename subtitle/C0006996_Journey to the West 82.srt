1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:18,489
"Oh no," thought Wukong. "Yellow Brows is coming!"

2
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,319
The monkey jumped back to his feet and ran fast out of the monastery.

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,216
When he got outside, everyone was waiting for him.

4
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:30,899
"Where are the bags?" asked Wujing.

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,317
[g@The monkey looked at his empty hands.

6
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:34,793
He slapped his forehead.@g]

7
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:37,092
"I must have dropped them."

8
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:40,743
He heard footsteps approaching from inside the monastery.

9
00:00:40,744 --> 00:00:44,341
"We can't worry about the bags now," whispered Wukong.

10
00:00:44,342 --> 00:00:46,217
[g@"Yellow Brows is coming.

11
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:50,472
We have to go—quickly!"@g]

12
00:00:50,473 --> 00:00:54,263
He helped the Tang Monk up onto the horse.

13
00:00:54,264 --> 00:01:02,796
The group hurried down the road.

14
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:06,145
"Run faster, Bajie!" hissed Wujing.

15
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:10,230
[g@Zhu Bajie breathed heavily.

16
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:15,018
"I . . . don't . . . like . . . running!"@g]

17
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:19,917
They hadn't gotten far before Yellow Brows flew over them.

18
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:23,593
"You can't escape from me!" shouted the demon.

19
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:26,587
"And you will not be going to the West.

20
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:33,469
I am a true Buddhist, and I will be the one to get the True Scriptures!"

21
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,788
Wukong, Bajie, and Wujing pulled out their weapons.

22
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:44,922
The Gold Dragon bared its claws.

23
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:46,519
[g@Yellow Brows scoffed.

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,813
"Do you really think you can fight me?"@g]

25
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:54,043
He reached into his robe and pulled out the cloth.

26
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:57,627
Bajie lowered his rake and laughed.

27
00:01:57,628 --> 00:02:00,116
[g@"We have powerful weapons.

28
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:03,354
And all you have is a piece of cloth!"@g]

29
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:07,252
"That's not an ordinary cloth," warned the dragon.

30
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:12,212
Yellow Brows threw the cloth toward the group.

31
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:14,943
"Look out!" cried Wukong.

32
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:20,056
The monkey leaped up to the sky just before the [n@cloth wrapped around his companions.

33
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,739
Quickly the demon grabbed the cloth, with the group in it.

34
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,203
He ran back into his monastery and slammed the door shut.

35
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:32,227
[g@Wukong sat down on a cloud to think.

36
00:02:32,228 --> 00:02:35,401
How could he rescue his companions?@g]

37
00:02:35,402 --> 00:02:39,163
"I can't ask the Jade Emperor for help," thought Wukong.

38
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:43,570
"He already sent the Gold Dragon, who was just captured again.

39
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:46,369
Maybe I can ask Guanyin for help."

40
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,282
As Wukong was wondering what to do, two spirits approached him.

41
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:54,860
One was a turtle, and the other was a serpent.

42
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:59,178
The two spirits each carried a sword and a shield.

43
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,974
[g@"We're from Wudang Mountain," said the turtle.

44
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,857
"We've come to help you."@g]

45
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:07,474
The serpent nodded.

46
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:13,360
"We heard the Tang Monk was captured by a demon called Yellow Brows."

47
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,326
"Thank you for coming," said Wukong.

48
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:19,891
He quickly told them what had happened.

49
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:23,433
"Let's go to the monastery now," said the turtle.

50
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:27,517
"Yellow Brows won't be able to fight all three of us."

51
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:31,466
"We are much too powerful for him," added the serpent.

52
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:37,502
Wukong led the two spirits down to the monastery.

53
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:41,588
"Just be careful of his cloth," warned the monkey.

54
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,570
"He'll try to capture us with it."

55
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,893
Wukong banged on the monastery door.

56
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,627
"Release my friends right now, Yellow Brows!

57
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:55,379
If you don't, I'll knock down your monastery!

58
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,065
Then I'll smash your entire mountain!"

59
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:01,227
[g@The door flew open.

60
00:04:01,228 --> 00:04:06,142
Yellow Brows stepped out and threw the cloth.@g]

61
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:08,494
"Look out!" cried Wukong.

62
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:13,157
The monkey jumped out of the way, but the turtle [n@and serpent weren't fast enough.

63
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:17,141
The cloth wrapped around them.

64
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:22,716
Laughing, the demon grabbed the bundle and went back into the monastery.

65
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:25,830
[g@Wukong flew back up into the sky.

66
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:29,659
He sat on a cloud and moaned.@g]

67
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,138
"Now what will I do?"

68
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:37,359
He was still thinking when he heard a voice. "Hello, Wukong!"

69
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,575
Wukong looked toward the voice and saw a man with a big belly.

70
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:43,553
The man was smiling.

71
00:04:43,554 --> 00:04:46,556
"Do you know who I am?" asked the man.

72
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:47,966
[g@Wukong smiled.

73
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:50,657
"You're the buddha Maitreya."@g]

74
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:58,333
"Yes," said Maitreya. "And I've come to help you."
