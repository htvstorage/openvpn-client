00:00:11,267 --> 130:06:51,267
Wukong looked at the Dragon King and sighed.

2
130:08:31,267 --> 201:06:51,267
[g@"You're right," said the monkey.

3
201:08:31,267 --> 277:36:51,267
"I did make a promise to Guanyin."@g]

4
277:38:31,267 --> 383:53:31,267
He put down his teacup and stood up.

5
383:55:11,267 --> 423:45:11,267
[g@"Thank you, my friend.

6
423:46:51,267 --> 487:05:11,267
I will visit again soon."@g]

7
487:06:51,267 --> 546:16:51,267
[g@The Dragon King smiled.

8
546:18:31,267 --> 606:40:11,267
"Good luck, Wukong."@g]

9
606:41:51,267 --> 812:13:31,267
The monkey hurried out of the Dragon King's palace.

10
812:15:11,267 --> 927:05:11,267
He found the Tang Monk traveling alongside a stream.

11
927:06:51,267 --> 1087:05:11,267
"Master, I have returned," he called.

12
1087:06:51,267 --> 1258:08:31,267
"I'm glad you're back, Wukong," said the monk. "I'm hungry."

13
1258:10:11,267 --> 1382:10:11,267
"I'll find a village and beg for some food for you," said the monkey.

14
1382:11:51,267 --> 1464:21:51,267
"You don't need to do that," said the monk.

15
1464:23:31,267 --> 1505:11:51,267
[g@"There's rice in the bag.

16
1505:13:31,267 --> 1554:08:31,267
You can cook that."@g]

17
1554:10:11,267 --> 1724:23:31,267
[g@The monk got down from the horse.

18
1724:25:11,267 --> 1796:58:31,267
Wukong opened the bag.@g]

19
1797:00:11,267 --> 1905:36:51,267
[g@When he looked inside, his eyes opened wide.

20
1905:38:31,267 --> 2004:08:31,267
He pulled out the headband.@g]

21
2004:10:11,267 --> 2111:58:31,267
"This headband is marvelous!" said Wukong.

22
2112:00:11,267 --> 2212:06:51,267
[g@"Oh," said the monk, watching the monkey closely.

23
2212:08:31,267 --> 2253:43:31,267
"Do you like it?"@g]

24
2253:45:11,267 --> 2324:25:11,267
"Yes!" said Wukong.

25
2324:26:51,267 --> 2401:51:51,267
"Try it on," said the monk.

26
2401:53:31,267 --> 2478:23:31,267
"Really?" asked Wukong.

27
2478:25:11,267 --> 2541:26:51,267
The monk nodded.

28
2541:28:31,267 --> 2724:36:51,267
[g@Wukong put the headband on.

29
2724:38:31,267 --> 2817:33:31,267
He looked at his reflection in the stream.@g]

30
2817:35:11,267 --> 2965:41:51,267
"I look handsome!" said Wukong. "Thanks forâ€”ahh!"

31
2965:43:31,267 --> 3070:55:11,267
The monkey grabbed the sides of his head and fell over.

32
3070:56:51,267 --> 3122:16:51,267
[g@His eyes bulged.

33
3122:18:31,267 --> 3264:41:51,267
"My head's going to explode!" he cried.@g]

34
3264:43:31,267 --> 3366:51:51,267
He saw the Tang Monk talking quietly.

35
3366:53:31,267 --> 3483:55:11,267
"Wh . . . What are you saying?" cried Wukong.

36
3483:56:51,267 --> 3600:28:31,267
The Tang Monk stopped talking, and the pain stopped.

37
3600:30:11,267 --> 3708:56:51,267
"The bodhisattva Guanyin taught me a spell," said the monk.

38
3708:58:31,267 --> 3804:53:31,267
"She gave me the headband to force you to be good."

39
3804:55:11,267 --> 3867:30:11,267
[g@Wukong pulled at the headband.

40
3867:31:51,267 --> 3926:08:31,267
But it wouldn't come off.@g]

41
3926:10:11,267 --> 4004:25:11,267
[g@"It's stuck!" cried the monkey.

42
4004:26:51,267 --> 4056:58:31,267
He stamped his foot.

43
4057:00:11,267 --> 4118:28:31,267
"You tricked me!"@g]

44
4118:30:11,267 --> 4193:05:11,267
[g@"It's for your own good," said the monk.

45
4193:06:51,267 --> 4271:35:11,267
"You must stop being violent."@g]

46
4271:36:51,267 --> 4471:50:11,267
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and lunged at the Tang Monk.

47
4471:51:51,267 --> 4584:13:31,267
The monk recited the Tight Headband spell again.

48
4584:15:11,267 --> 4740:15:11,267
Wukong fell to the ground and rolled around in pain.

49
4740:16:51,267 --> 4855:23:31,267
"It hurts! It hurts!" he cried.

50
4855:25:11,267 --> 4971:41:51,267
"Please stop! I won't try to hurt you again!"

51
4971:43:31,267 --> 5118:25:11,267
The Tang Monk stopped, and the monkey stood up.

52
5118:26:51,267 --> 5221:41:51,267
"Now will you cook some rice?" asked the monk.

53
5221:43:31,267 --> 5314:53:31,267
"I'll get a fire started," said Wukong.

54
5314:55:11,267 --> 5424:56:51,267
The monkey waited until the Tang Monk had turned his back.

55
5424:58:31,267 --> 5513:58:31,267
Again he raised the iron bar.

56
5514:00:11,267 --> 5623:40:11,267
But the Tang Monk saw Wukong's shadow.

57
5623:41:51,267 --> 5755:08:31,267
"Ahh!" cried Wukong, once again falling to the ground.

58
5755:10:11,267 --> 5864:03:31,267
The Tang Monk looked furious as he recited the spell.

59
5864:05:11,267 --> 5936:08:31,267
Wukong's head pounded.

60
5936:10:11,267 --> 6029:16:51,267
"Please stop!" cried the monkey.

61
6029:18:31,267 --> 6118:25:11,267
The Tang Monk stopped reciting the spell.

62
6118:26:51,267 --> 6197:48:31,267
"Don't try to hit me again," said the monk.

63
6197:50:11,267 --> 6327:05:11,267
"If you do, I'll recite the spell until your head really does explode."

64
6327:06:51,267 --> 6405:45:11,267
[g@"I'm sorry, Master," said Wukong.

65
6405:46:51,267 --> 6511:46:51,267
"I'll be good!"@g]

66
6511:48:31,267 --> 6621:33:31,267
[g@The two traveled for a few more weeks.

67
6621:35:11,267 --> 6701:26:51,267
They arrived at a wide river.@g]

68
6701:28:31,267 --> 6793:35:11,267
"How will we cross this river?" asked the monk.

69
6793:36:51,267 --> 6897:00:11,267
"It's too bad you're not a spirit," said Wukong.

70
6897:01:51,267 --> 6947:53:31,267
[g@"I can leap over this river.

71
6947:55:11,267 --> 7008:35:11,267
But I can't take you with me."@g]

72
7008:36:51,267 --> 7092:06:51,267
"Why not?" asked the Tang Monk.

73
7092:08:31,267 --> 7164:36:51,267
"You're a human," said the monkey.

74
7164:38:31,267 --> 7247:46:51,267
"So you must make the journey all by yourself.

75
7247:48:31,267 --> 7293:05:11,267
[g@I can only protect you.

76
7293:06:51,267 --> 7338:06:51,267
I can't carry you."@g]

77
7338:08:31,267 --> 7417:25:11,267
"What will we do then?" asked the monk.

78
7417:26:51,267 --> 7667:40:11,267
Before Wukong could answer, the water swelled and a dragon leaped from it.

79
7667:41:51,267 --> 7762:16:51,267
"Look out!" cried the monkey.

80
7762:18:31,267 --> 7884:11:51,267
He yanked the Tang Monk off the horse as the dragon struck.

81
7884:13:31,267 --> 8190:51:51,267
With one bite, the dragon swallowed the horse [n@and then slipped back underwater.
