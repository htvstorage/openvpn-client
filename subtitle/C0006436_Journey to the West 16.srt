1
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:15,951
Wukong looked at the Dragon King and sighed.

2
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:18,507
"You're right," said the monkey.

3
00:00:18,508 --> 00:00:21,261
"I did make a promise to Guanyin."

4
00:00:21,262 --> 00:00:25,087
He put down his teacup and stood up.

5
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,522
"Thank you, my friend.

6
00:00:26,523 --> 00:00:28,802
I will visit again soon."

7
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:30,933
The Dragon King smiled.

8
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:33,107
"Good luck, Wukong."

9
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:40,507
The monkey hurried out of the Dragon King's palace.

10
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:44,642
He found the Tang Monk traveling alongside a stream.

11
00:00:44,643 --> 00:00:50,402
"Master, I have returned," he called.

12
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:56,560
"I'm glad you're back, Wukong," said the monk. "I'm hungry."

13
00:00:56,561 --> 00:01:01,025
"I'll find a village and beg for some food for you," said the monkey.

14
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:03,984
"You don't need to do that," said the monk.

15
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:05,454
"There's rice in the bag.

16
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:07,216
You can cook that."

17
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:13,345
The monk got down from the horse.

18
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:15,958
Wukong opened the bag.

19
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,869
When he looked inside, his eyes opened wide.

20
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,416
He pulled out the headband.

21
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,298
"This headband is marvelous!" said Wukong.

22
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,903
"Oh," said the monk, watching the monkey closely.

23
00:01:30,904 --> 00:01:32,401
"Do you like it?"

24
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:34,946
"Yes!" said Wukong.

25
00:01:34,947 --> 00:01:37,734
"Try it on," said the monk.

26
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:40,489
"Really?" asked Wukong.

27
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,759
The monk nodded.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:49,353
Wukong put the headband on.

29
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:52,699
He looked at his reflection in the stream.

30
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,032
"I look handsome!" said Wukong. "Thanks forâ€”ahh!"

31
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:01,820
The monkey grabbed the sides of his head and fell over.

32
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,669
His eyes bulged.

33
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,796
"My head's going to explode!" he cried.

34
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:12,474
He saw the Tang Monk talking quietly.

35
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:16,688
"Wh . . . What are you saying?" cried Wukong.

36
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:20,884
The Tang Monk stopped talking, and the pain stopped.

37
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:24,789
"The bodhisattva Guanyin taught me a spell," said the monk.

38
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,243
"She gave me the headband to force you to be good."

39
00:02:28,244 --> 00:02:30,497
Wukong pulled at the headband.

40
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:32,608
But it wouldn't come off.

41
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:35,426
"It's stuck!" cried the monkey.

42
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:37,318
He stamped his foot.

43
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,532
"You tricked me!"

44
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:42,218
"It's for your own good," said the monk.

45
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:45,044
"You must stop being violent."

46
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:52,253
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and lunged at the Tang Monk.

47
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:56,299
The monk recited the Tight Headband spell again.

48
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,916
Wukong fell to the ground and rolled around in pain.

49
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:06,061
"It hurts! It hurts!" he cried.

50
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:10,248
"Please stop! I won't try to hurt you again!"

51
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:15,530
The Tang Monk stopped, and the monkey stood up.

52
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:19,248
"Now will you cook some rice?" asked the monk.

53
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:22,603
"I'll get a fire started," said Wukong.

54
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:26,565
The monkey waited until the Tang Monk had turned his back.

55
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:29,770
Again he raised the iron bar.

56
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:33,719
But the Tang Monk saw Wukong's shadow.

57
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,452
"Ahh!" cried Wukong, once again falling to the ground.

58
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:42,373
The Tang Monk looked furious as he recited the spell.

59
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:44,968
Wukong's head pounded.

60
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:48,321
"Please stop!" cried the monkey.

61
00:03:48,322 --> 00:03:51,530
The Tang Monk stopped reciting the spell.

62
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,388
"Don't try to hit me again," said the monk.

63
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:59,042
"If you do, I'll recite the spell until your head really does explode."

64
00:03:59,043 --> 00:04:01,874
"I'm sorry, Master," said Wukong.

65
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:05,691
"I'll be good!"

66
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:09,643
The two traveled for a few more weeks.

67
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:12,519
They arrived at a wide river.

68
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,836
"How will we cross this river?" asked the monk.

69
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:19,559
"It's too bad you're not a spirit," said Wukong.

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,391
"I can leap over this river.

71
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:23,576
But I can't take you with me."

72
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:26,583
"Why not?" asked the Tang Monk.

73
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:29,193
"You're a human," said the monkey.

74
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:32,187
"So you must make the journey all by yourself.

75
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,818
I can only protect you.

76
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:35,439
I can't carry you."

77
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,294
"What will we do then?" asked the monk.

78
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:47,303
Before Wukong could answer, the water swelled and a dragon leaped from it.

79
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:50,709
"Look out!" cried the monkey.

80
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,098
He yanked the Tang Monk off the horse as the dragon struck.

81
00:04:55,099 --> 00:05:06,138
With one bite, the dragon swallowed the horse and then slipped back underwater.
