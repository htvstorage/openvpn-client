1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:15,167
Wukong was furious.

2
00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:18,681
"The Bull Demon King tricked me!"

3
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:24,921
The monkey rushed back to the cave and smashed the door. Crash!

4
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:28,067
The Bull Demon King ran outside.

5
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:33,906
"You villain!" he shouted. "You destroyed my door!"

6
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:37,357
"Give me that fan right now!" yelled Wukong.

7
00:00:37,358 --> 00:00:40,887
"Or I'll destroy the rest of your mountain!"

8
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:44,731
"Never!" said the demon.

9
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:48,815
Wukong charged toward the demon.

10
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:53,064
Poof! The demon turned into a crane and flew away.

11
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:58,766
"He's not the only one who can turn into other animals," thought the monkey.

12
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:04,475
Wukong turned into a phoenix and shot after the crane.

13
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:08,188
With his claws out, he swooped down at the crane.

14
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,931
The crane dipped lower and Wukong missed.

15
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:15,794
When Wukong looked back, the crane was gone.

16
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:18,289
"Where did he go?" thought Wukong.

17
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:24,204
He looked down and saw an antelope grazing in a field. "That's him!"

18
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:27,448
Wukong landed and turned into a tiger.

19
00:01:27,449 --> 00:01:31,162
He crept through the tall grass.

20
00:01:31,163 --> 00:01:35,584
When he got close to the antelope, he leaped.

21
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:41,452
Light flashed, and the antelope turned into a huge white bull.

22
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:46,023
The bull flew up into the sky, and Wukong followed.

23
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:49,595
He had almost caught up to the bull, when he heard a shout.

24
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:52,298
"Stand back, Wukong!"

25
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,829
It was a soldier from Heaven.

26
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,919
"The Jade Emperor sent us to help you."

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,985
More soldiers rushed toward the bull.

28
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:05,074
With a snort, the bull spun around and flew the other way.

29
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:09,453
But other soldiers appeared and blocked the bull's path.

30
00:02:09,454 --> 00:02:13,290
Wukong watched as soldiers surrounded the bull.

31
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:20,033
They moved in closer, their swords and spears all pointed at the bull.

32
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:23,855
The Bull Demon King returned to his demon form.

33
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:27,204
"Please, don't hurt me!"

34
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:30,536
The Iron Immortal was rushing toward the soldiers.

35
00:02:30,537 --> 00:02:33,219
"Don't harm my husband!" she cried.

36
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,890
"He didn't mean to be evil!"

37
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:38,280
One soldier lowered his sword.

38
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,470
"We won't harm you if you're truly sorry for being evil.

39
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:45,596
But right now you're stopping the Tang Monk from continuing his journey.

40
00:02:45,597 --> 00:02:48,298
Sun Wukong needs your fan."

41
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:52,129
The Iron Immortal handed the fan to the soldier.

42
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,224
"Here's the fan," she said.

43
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:56,402
"We are truly sorry.

44
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:59,700
My husband and I will be good Buddhists from now on.

45
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:02,522
Just please, don't hurt us."

46
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:05,503
The soldier looked at the Bull Demon King.

47
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:09,420
The demon nodded. "We promise."

48
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:12,329
"Very well," said the soldier.

49
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,868
"You two may return to your cave.

50
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:17,861
But you must stay out of trouble from now on."

51
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:22,077
The demon and his wife bowed and left.

52
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:26,036
The soldier handed the fan to Wukong.

53
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:30,131
"It's good that you'll be the one to put out the Mountain of Flames, Wukong."

54
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:33,922
Wukong was confused. "Why?"

55
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:40,638
"You're the one who caused the fire," said the soldier.

56
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,787
"It was when Laozi tried to burn you up in his pot.

57
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:48,203
You leaped out of the pot, disturbing the fire in his workroom.

58
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:52,989
A burning ember fell to Earth that day and started the fire on the mountain."

59
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,095
Wukong looked at the fan.

60
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:59,409
"I'll be happy to put out the fire."

61
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,201
Wukong returned to the village.

62
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:06,445
The Tang Monk and his companions were at the old man's house again.

63
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:11,073
Once again they thanked the man and followed the road up the hill.

64
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:14,962
At the top they looked at the Mountain of Flames.

65
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:20,268
Wukong lifted the fan and waved it. Whoosh!

66
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,388
Instantly the fire went out.

67
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:29,563
The air cooled down, and Wukong saw the valley start to turn green.

68
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:35,362
Leaves grew on trees, and small flowers popped up here and there.

69
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:40,216
Birds sang in the branches as other animals ran through the grass.

70
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:42,079
Wukong smiled.

71
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,114
He had done evil things a long time ago.

72
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:51,797
Now he was fixing them.
