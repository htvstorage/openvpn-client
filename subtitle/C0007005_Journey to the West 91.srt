00:00:10,933.3329999999987 --> 147:18:30,933.3330000042915
The demon general looked at Wukong, who was still in disguise.

2
147:20:10,933.3330000042915 --> 266:46:50,933.3329999446869
"The Tang Monk is heading toward our mountain?" the general asked.

3
266:48:30,933.3329999446869 --> 343:35:10,933.3329999446869
"Yes," said Wukong.

4
343:36:50,933.3329999446869 --> 457:26:50,933.3329999446869
"That is great news," said a demon captain.

5
457:28:30,933.3329999446869 --> 547:56:50,933.3329999446869
"Unfortunately there's also some bad news."

6
547:58:30,933.3329999446869 --> 623:31:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong pretended to look worried.

7
623:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 714:15:10,933.3330001831055
[g@"The Tang Monk has three companions.

8
714:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 782:46:50,933.3330001831055
One is a big purple fellow.@g]

9
782:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 925:16:50,933.3330001831055
Another is a pig who appears to be quite lazy."

10
925:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1016:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@The general narrowed his eyes at Wukong.

11
1016:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 1098:38:30,933.3330001831055
"And the third companion?"@g]

12
1098:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1194:38:30,933.3330001831055
"The third companion is a monkey," said Wukong.

13
1194:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1325:33:30,933.3330001831055
"I believe he is Sun Wukong."

14
1325:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1463:38:30,933.3330001831055
"I was afraid that monkey was traveling with [n@the monk," the general grumbled.

15
1463:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1546:08:30,933.3330001831055
"What does Sun Wukong look like?"

16
1546:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1697:38:30,933.3330001831055
"He's huge." Wukong pretended to shiver.

17
1697:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1827:08:30,933.3330001831055
"He has fiery red eyes and sharp fangs."

18
1827:10:10,933.3330001831055 --> 1903:35:10,933.3330001831055
"Oh dear," said a captain.

19
1903:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2043:16:50,933.3330001831055
"There's no need to worry about some silly monkey," said the colonel.

20
2043:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2115:53:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"I don't care what he did five hundred years ago.

21
2115:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2197:26:50,933.3330001831055
We have a powerful army."@g]

22
2197:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2293:16:50,933.3330001831055
"I heard the monkey talking," said Wukong.

23
2293:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2433:06:50,933.3330001831055
"He said he [i@hopes@i] there's an entire demon army on this mountain."

24
2433:08:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2521:28:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"What?" The general looked confused.

25
2521:30:10,933.3330001831055 --> 2597:26:50,933.3330001831055
"He hopes there's an army?"@g]

26
2597:28:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2747:11:50,933.3330001831055
Wukong nodded. "He said destroying demons is good exercise.

27
2747:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 2817:45:10,933.3330001831055
He has a magic iron bar.

28
2817:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 2957:16:50,933.3330001831055
He can make it big enough to crush our entire army with one strike.

29
2957:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3059:33:30,933.3330001831055
But he doesn't plan to do that."

30
3059:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3177:53:30,933.3330001831055
A captain gulped. "What [i@does@i] he plan to do?"

31
3177:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3300:33:30,933.3330001831055
"He plans to crush one demon at a time," said Wukong.

32
3300:35:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3397:35:10,933.3330001831055
"That way he'll get more exercise."

33
3397:36:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3472:16:50,933.3330001831055
The demons' faces went pale.

34
3472:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3576:30:10,933.3330001831055
"This is bad news," said the general.

35
3576:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3677:01:50,933.3330001831055
The other demons nodded in agreement.

36
3677:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 3791:53:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"You can all stick around if you want to," said Wukong.

37
3791:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 3905:55:10,933.3330001831055
"But I'm leaving."@g]

38
3905:56:50,933.3330001831055 --> 3981:01:50,933.3330001831055
A captain looked surprised.

39
3981:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4037:43:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"What about eating the Tang Monk?

40
4037:45:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4116:58:30,933.3330001831055
Don't you want to live forever?"@g]

41
4117:00:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4158:25:10,933.3330001831055
[g@Wukong shook his head.

42
4158:26:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4251:38:30,933.3330001831055
"I heard our three leaders talking privately.@g]

43
4251:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4343:51:50,933.3330001831055
They don't plan to share the Tang Monk with us.

44
4343:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4443:03:30,933.3330001831055
They're going to eat him themselves."

45
4443:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 4521:00:10,933.3330001831055
The officers grew angry.

46
4521:01:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4603:31:50,933.3330001831055
"That's not fair!" said the colonel.

47
4603:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4683:20:10,933.3330001831055
"It's terrible!" said a captain.

48
4683:21:50,933.3330001831055 --> 4746:56:50,933.3330001831055
The general bit his lip.

49
4746:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 4924:41:50,933.3330001831055
"If our leaders won't share the Tang Monk with us, [n@they can catch him themselves.

50
4924:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5054:05:10,933.3330001831055
Let's gather the troops and leave this place."

51
5054:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5228:31:50,933.3330001831055
Soon Wukong could see the demon army marching away in the valley below.

52
5228:33:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5272:05:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey smiled.

53
5272:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 5332:53:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"I got rid of the army.

54
5332:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 5526:36:50,933.3330001831055
Now I'll deal with the three demon leaders."@g]

55
5526:38:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5653:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@Still in disguise, Wukong entered the cave.

56
5653:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5729:16:50,933.3330001831055
He came to a large room.@g]

57
5729:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 5964:10:10,933.3330001831055
Three huge demons—a lion, an elephant, and a raptor—sat on thrones.

58
5964:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6118:38:30,933.3330001831055
"The Tang Monk is heading toward the mountain," Wukong announced.

59
6118:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6202:03:30,933.3330001831055
[g@"Excellent," said the lion.

60
6202:05:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6319:38:30,933.3330001831055
"Tell the troops to capture him."@g]

61
6319:40:10,933.3330001831055 --> 6413:10:10,933.3330001831055
"The troops left," said Wukong.

62
6413:11:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6548:05:10,933.3330001831055
"What!" shouted the raptor. "Why?"

63
6548:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 6665:16:50,933.3330001831055
"The Tang Monk is traveling with Sun Wukong," said the monkey.

64
6665:18:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6763:46:50,933.3330001831055
"The troops were afraid of the monkey."

65
6763:48:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6914:11:50,933.3330001831055
"So it's true that Sun Wukong is with the monk," said the elephant.

66
6914:13:30,933.3330001831055 --> 6974:31:50,933.3330001831055

7067:25:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7175:41:50,933.3330001831055
[g@"Nonsense!" said the lion.

69
7175:43:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7293:56:50,933.3330001831055
"We don't need an army to fight a monkey.@g]

7293:58:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7434:30:10,933.3330001831055
We'll capture the Tang Monk ourselves."

71
7434:31:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7531:51:50,933.3330001831055
"You're crazy!" said the elephant.

72
7531:53:30,933.3330001831055 --> 7657:48:30,933.3330001831055
"Sun Wukong defeated Heaven's entire army!"

73
7657:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 7810:15:10,933.3330001831055
"Don't call me crazy!" shouted the lion.

74
7810:16:50,933.3330001831055 --> 7957:01:50,933.3330001831055
"Don't shout at me!" shouted the elephant.

75
7957:03:30,933.3330001831055 --> 8125:53:30,933.3330001831055
"I'll shout at anyone I want to!" shouted the lion.

76
8125:55:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8291:48:30,933.3330001831055
As the two demons argued, Wukong began to laugh.

77
8291:50:10,933.3330001831055 --> 8361:45:10,933.3330001831055
Soon he was laughing hard.

78
8361:46:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8495:05:10,933.3330001831055
The demons stopped arguing and stared at him.

79
8495:06:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8617:50:10,933.3330001831055
The monkey looked down and saw that his disguise was gone.

80
8617:51:50,933.3330001831055 --> 8827:40:10,933.3330001831055
He gulped. "Uh-oh!"
