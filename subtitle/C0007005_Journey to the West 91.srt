1
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:16,236
The demon general looked at Wukong, who was still in disguise.

2
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:20,537
"The Tang Monk is heading toward our mountain?" the general asked.

3
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:23,302
"Yes," said Wukong.

4
00:00:23,303 --> 00:00:27,401
"That is great news," said a demon captain.

5
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,659
"Unfortunately there's also some bad news."

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,380
Wukong pretended to look worried.

7
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:36,646
[g@"The Tang Monk has three companions.

8
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:39,113
One is a big purple fellow.@g]

9
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:44,243
Another is a pig who appears to be quite lazy."

10
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,534
[g@The general narrowed his eyes at Wukong.

11
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:50,484
"And the third companion?"@g]

12
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:53,940
"The third companion is a monkey," said Wukong.

13
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:58,653
"I believe he is Sun Wukong."

14
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:03,624
"I was afraid that monkey was traveling with [n@the monk," the general grumbled.

15
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,594
"What does Sun Wukong look like?"

16
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:12,048
"He's huge." Wukong pretended to shiver.

17
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:16,710
"He has fiery red eyes and sharp fangs."

18
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:19,462
"Oh dear," said a captain.

19
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:24,491
"There's no need to worry about some silly monkey," said the colonel.

20
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:27,105
[g@"I don't care what he did five hundred years ago.

21
00:01:27,106 --> 00:01:30,041
We have a powerful army."@g]

22
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:33,491
"I heard the monkey talking," said Wukong.

23
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:38,525
"He said he [i@hopes@i] there's an entire demon army on this mountain."

24
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:41,706
[g@"What?" The general looked confused.

25
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:44,441
"He hopes there's an army?"@g]

26
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:49,832
Wukong nodded. "He said destroying demons is good exercise.

27
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,372
He has a magic iron bar.

28
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:57,395
He can make it big enough to crush our entire army with one strike.

29
00:01:57,396 --> 00:02:01,077
But he doesn't plan to do that."

30
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,337
A captain gulped. "What [i@does@i] he plan to do?"

31
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:09,753
"He plans to crush one demon at a time," said Wukong.

32
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:13,246
"That way he'll get more exercise."

33
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:15,935
The demons' faces went pale.

34
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,687
"This is bad news," said the general.

35
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:23,306
The other demons nodded in agreement.

36
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:27,441
[g@"You can all stick around if you want to," said Wukong.

37
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:31,546
"But I'm leaving."@g]

38
00:02:31,547 --> 00:02:34,250
A captain looked surprised.

39
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:36,291
[g@"What about eating the Tang Monk?

40
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:39,144
Don't you want to live forever?"@g]

41
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:40,636
[g@Wukong shook his head.

42
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:43,992
"I heard our three leaders talking privately.@g]

43
00:02:43,993 --> 00:02:47,312
They don't plan to share the Tang Monk with us.

44
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:50,883
They're going to eat him themselves."

45
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:53,689
The officers grew angry.

46
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,660
"That's not fair!" said the colonel.

47
00:02:56,661 --> 00:02:59,533
"It's terrible!" said a captain.

48
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:01,823
The general bit his lip.

49
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:08,222
"If our leaders won't share the Tang Monk with us, [n@they can catch him themselves.

50
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:12,880
Let's gather the troops and leave this place."

51
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:19,160
Soon Wukong could see the demon army marching away in the valley below.

52
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:20,728
The monkey smiled.

53
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:22,917
[g@"I got rid of the army.

54
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:29,891
Now I'll deal with the three demon leaders."@g]

55
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:34,466
[g@Still in disguise, Wukong entered the cave.

56
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:37,187
He came to a large room.@g]

57
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:45,643
Three huge demons—a lion, an elephant, and a raptor—sat on thrones.

58
00:03:45,644 --> 00:03:51,204
"The Tang Monk is heading toward the mountain," Wukong announced.

59
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:54,207
[g@"Excellent," said the lion.

60
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:58,440
"Tell the troops to capture him."@g]

61
00:03:58,441 --> 00:04:01,807
"The troops left," said Wukong.

62
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:06,664
"What!" shouted the raptor. "Why?"

63
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:10,883
"The Tang Monk is traveling with Sun Wukong," said the monkey.

64
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:14,429
"The troops were afraid of the monkey."

65
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,844
"So it's true that Sun Wukong is with the monk," said the elephant.

66
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:22,016
[g@"That monkey is powerful.

67
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:25,359
We should leave the Tang Monk alone."@g]

68
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,258
[g@"Nonsense!" said the lion.

69
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,515
"We don't need an army to fight a monkey.@g]

70
00:04:33,516 --> 00:04:38,575
We'll capture the Tang Monk ourselves."

71
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:42,080
"You're crazy!" said the elephant.

72
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:46,614
"Sun Wukong defeated Heaven's entire army!"

73
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:52,102
"Don't call me crazy!" shouted the lion.

74
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:57,386
"Don't shout at me!" shouted the elephant.

75
00:04:57,387 --> 00:05:03,465
"I'll shout at anyone I want to!" shouted the lion.

76
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:09,438
As the two demons argued, Wukong began to laugh.

77
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,956
Soon he was laughing hard.

78
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:16,756
The demons stopped arguing and stared at him.

79
00:05:16,757 --> 00:05:21,175
The monkey looked down and saw that his disguise was gone.

80
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:28,729
He gulped. "Uh-oh!"
