[g@The Daoist had vanished!

93:50:11,066.66699999570847 --> 274:56:51,066.66700005531311
Wukong ran outside and shot into the air.@g]

274:58:31,066.66700005531311 --> 350:10:11,066.66700005531311
He looked in every direction.

4
350:11:51,066.66700005531311 --> 435:48:31,066.66700005531311
"Where did the Daoist go?" asked the monkey.

5
435:50:11,066.66700005531311 --> 535:11:51,066.66700005531311
Then he heard a shout from inside the palace.

6
535:13:31,066.66700005531311 --> 732:56:51,066.66699981689453
"There are two Tang Monks!" cried Bajie.

7
732:58:31,066.66699981689453 --> 875:08:31,066.66699981689453
[g@Wukong flew back inside.

875:10:11,066.66699981689453 --> 982:53:31,066.66699981689453
Two Tang Monks stood side by side.@g]

982:55:11,066.66699981689453 --> 1066:08:31,066.66699981689453
[g@"We can't tell them apart," said Wujing.

10
1066:10:11,066.66699981689453 --> 1132:21:51,066.66699981689453
"They look exactly alike."@g]

11
1132:23:31,066.66699981689453 --> 1257:01:51,066.66699981689453
"Which one of you is the real Tang Monk?" asked Wukong.

12
1257:03:31,066.66699981689453 --> 1311:26:51,066.66699981689453
"I am!" said one.

13
1311:28:31,066.66699981689453 --> 1430:46:51,066.66699981689453
The other monk glared at the first one. "No, I am!"

14
1430:48:31,066.66699981689453 --> 1500:26:51,066.66699981689453
The first monk looked at Wukong.

15
1500:28:31,066.66699981689453 --> 1550:10:11,066.66699981689453
[g@"Don't believe him, Wukong.

1550:11:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1616:55:11,066.66699981689453
I am the real Tang Monk."@g]

17
1616:56:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1692:40:11,066.66699981689453
[g@"Don't believe [i@him!@i]" said the other monk.

18
1692:41:51,066.66699981689453 --> 1784:51:51,066.66699981689453
"[i@I@i] am the real Tang Monk."@g]

19
1784:53:31,066.66699981689453 --> 1911:43:31,066.66699981689453
Angry, Wukong pulled out his iron bar.

20
1911:45:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2010:18:31,066.66699981689453
"Which one of you is the real Tang Monk?"

21
2010:20:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2128:03:31,066.66699981689453
Both Tang Monks fell to their knees, shaking with fear.

22
2128:05:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2239:53:31,066.66699981689453
"Don't hit me!" they both cried.

23
2239:55:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2290:41:51,066.66699981689453
[g@The monkey sighed.

24
2290:43:31,066.66699981689453 --> 2355:53:31,066.66699981689453
He turned to Bajie and Wujing.

25
2355:55:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2462:28:31,066.66699981689453
"What can we do?"@g]

26
2462:30:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2559:28:31,066.66699981689453
[g@"I have an idea," said Bajie, smiling.

27
2559:30:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2621:43:31,066.66699981689453
"But you won't like it."@g]

28
2621:45:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2754:03:31,066.66699981689453
"What is it?" asked Wukong.

29
2754:05:11,066.66699981689453 --> 2884:16:51,066.66699981689453
"The two Tang Monks should recite the Tight Headband spell," said the pig.

30
2884:18:31,066.66699981689453 --> 3032:40:11,066.66699981689453
"Only the Tang Monk, Guanyin, and Buddha know the spell.

31
3032:41:51,066.66699981689453 --> 3136:38:31,066.66699981689453
We'll know right away which Tang Monk is fake."

32
3136:40:11,066.66699981689453 --> 3263:56:51,066.66699981689453
"You just want to see me in pain!" said Wukong.

33
3263:58:31,066.66699981689453 --> 3414:46:51,066.66699981689453
Then he sighed. "But it is a good idea."

34
3414:48:31,066.66699981689453 --> 3536:38:31,066.66699981689453
Bajie and Wujing stood near the monks.

35
3536:40:11,066.66699981689453 --> 3665:30:11,066.66699981689453
"Master, recite the Tight Headband spell," said Wukong.

36
3665:31:51,066.66699981689453 --> 3805:15:11,066.66699981689453
Both monks began speaking, and Wukong fell to the floor.

37
3805:16:51,066.66699981689453 --> 3892:30:11,066.66699981689453
"It hurts!" he cried.

38
3892:31:51,066.66699981689453 --> 3990:08:31,066.66699981689453
Bajie watched the Tang Monks carefully.

39
3990:10:11,066.66699981689453 --> 4077:36:51,066.66699981689453
[g@One of them was reciting the spell.

40
4077:38:31,066.66699981689453 --> 4147:43:31,066.66699981689453
But the other one wasn't.@g]

41
4147:45:11,066.66699981689453 --> 4256:01:51,066.66699981689453
"This is the fake Tang Monk!" shouted the pig, pointing.

42
4256:03:31,066.66699981689453 --> 4351:11:51,066.66699981689453
"He's just mumbling nonsense!"

43
4351:13:31,066.66699981689453 --> 4448:58:31,066.66699981689453
The real monk stopped reciting the spell.

44
4449:00:11,066.66699981689453 --> 4554:26:51,066.66699981689453
Bajie and Wujing tried to grab the fake monk.

45
4554:28:31,066.66699981689453 --> 4733:56:51,066.66699981689453
But the monk changed into a green lion and ran out of the throne room.

46
4733:58:31,066.66699981689453 --> 4811:43:31,066.66699981689453
"Get him!" shouted Wukong.

47
4811:45:11,066.66699981689453 --> 4911:51:51,066.66699981689453
He and his companions chased the lion.

48
4911:53:31,066.66699981689453 --> 5018:11:51,066.66699981689453
Outside, the lion leaped into the air.

49
5018:13:31,066.66699981689453 --> 5096:56:51,066.66699981689453
Wukong and the others shot after him.

50
5096:58:31,066.66699981689453 --> 5248:50:11,066.66699981689453
Clouds swirled, and soon they had the lion surrounded.

51
5248:51:51,066.66699981689453 --> 5384:46:51,066.66699981689453
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and raised it to strike.

52
5384:48:31,066.66699981689453 --> 5550:45:11,066.66699981689453
Just then a deep voice called out, "Do not hit him, Sun Wukong!"

53
5550:46:51,066.66699981689453 --> 5634:00:11,066.66699981689453
Everyone looked up.

54
5634:01:51,066.66699981689453 --> 5739:18:31,066.66699981689453
"It's the bodhisattva Manjusri!" said Wukong.

55
5739:20:11,066.66699981689453 --> 5846:05:11,066.66699981689453
"This green lion is my pet," said the bodhisattva.

56
5846:06:51,066.66699981689453 --> 5992:18:31,066.66699981689453
"The king of the Black Rooster Kingdom was [n@cruel to someone many years ago.

59
6189:01:51,066.66699981689453 --> 6330:01:51,066.66699981689453
The bodhisattva and the lion disappeared above the clouds.

60
6330:03:31,066.66699981689453 --> 6461:06:51,066.66699981689453
That night the king of the Black Rooster Kingdom hosted a feast.

61
6461:08:31,066.66699981689453 --> 6571:20:11,066.66699981689453
[g@During the feast he turned to the Tang Monk.

"Thank you for your help.@g]

I hope you will reach the Western Paradise very soon."

64
6796:26:51,066.66699981689453 --> 6937:38:31,066.66699981689453
Weeks passed, and the travelers continued west.

6937:40:11,066.66699981689453 --> 7095:50:11,066.66699981689453
One day Wukong saw a mysterious red cloud over the mountains ahead.

66
7095:51:51,066.66699981689453 --> 7199:15:11,066.66699981689453
"Stop walking," he said quietly.

7199:16:51,066.66699981689453 --> 7295:23:31,066.66699981689453
"What's wrong?" asked the Tang Monk.

68
7295:25:11,066.66699981689453 --> 7351:28:31,066.66699981689453

"Nothing, Master. I thought I saw a red cloud."

7563:33:31,066.66699981689453 --> 7650:18:31,066.66699981689453

7828:10:11,066.66699981689453 --> 7979:53:31,066.66699981689453
The red cloud disappeared once again, and Wukong started to walk again.
