1
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:14,444
The Daoist had vanished!

2
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:20,965
Wukong ran outside and shot into the air.

3
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:23,673
He looked in every direction.

4
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:26,756
"Where did the Daoist go?" asked the monkey.

5
00:00:26,757 --> 00:00:30,334
Then he heard a shout from inside the palace.

6
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:37,453
"There are two Tang Monks!" cried Bajie.

7
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:42,572
Wukong flew back inside.

8
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:46,451
Two Tang Monks stood side by side.

9
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:49,448
"We can't tell them apart," said Wujing.

10
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,832
"They look exactly alike."

11
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:56,320
"Which one of you is the real Tang Monk?" asked Wukong.

12
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:58,279
"I am!" said one.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,575
The other monk glared at the first one. "No, I am!"

14
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:05,083
The first monk looked at Wukong.

15
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:06,873
"Don't believe him, Wukong.

16
00:01:06,874 --> 00:01:09,276
I am the real Tang Monk."

17
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,003
"Don't believe him!" said the other monk.

18
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:15,322
"I am the real Tang Monk."

19
00:01:15,323 --> 00:01:19,889
Angry, Wukong pulled out his iron bar.

20
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,438
"Which one of you is the real Tang Monk?"

21
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,677
Both Tang Monks fell to their knees, shaking with fear.

22
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:31,703
"Don't hit me!" they both cried.

23
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:33,532
The monkey sighed.

24
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:35,879
He turned to Bajie and Wujing.

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,716
"What can we do?"

26
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:43,208
"I have an idea," said Bajie, smiling.

27
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:45,449
"But you won't like it."

28
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,213
"What is it?" asked Wukong.

29
00:01:50,214 --> 00:01:54,901
"The two Tang Monks should recite the Tight Headband spell," said the pig.

30
00:01:54,902 --> 00:02:00,243
"Only the Tang Monk, Guanyin, and Buddha know the spell.

31
00:02:00,244 --> 00:02:03,986
We'll know right away which Tang Monk is fake."

32
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:08,569
"You just want to see me in pain!" said Wukong.

33
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:13,999
Then he sighed. "But it is a good idea."

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,386
Bajie and Wujing stood near the monks.

35
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:23,025
"Master, recite the Tight Headband spell," said Wukong.

36
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:28,056
Both monks began speaking, and Wukong fell to the floor.

37
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:31,197
"It hurts!" he cried.

38
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:34,712
Bajie watched the Tang Monks carefully.

39
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:37,861
One of them was reciting the spell.

40
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:40,385
But the other one wasn't.

41
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:44,284
"This is the fake Tang Monk!" shouted the pig, pointing.

42
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:47,710
"He's just mumbling nonsense!"

43
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:51,230
The real monk stopped reciting the spell.

44
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:55,027
Bajie and Wujing tried to grab the fake monk.

45
00:02:55,028 --> 00:03:01,489
But the monk changed into a green lion and ran out of the throne room.

46
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,289
"Get him!" shouted Wukong.

47
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,894
He and his companions chased the lion.

48
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:11,722
Outside, the lion leaped into the air.

49
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:14,557
Wukong and the others shot after him.

50
00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:20,025
Clouds swirled, and soon they had the lion surrounded.

51
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:24,919
Wukong pulled out his iron bar and raised it to strike.

52
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,894
Just then a deep voice called out, "Do not hit him, Sun Wukong!"

53
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:33,891
Everyone looked up.

54
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:37,682
"It's the bodhisattva Manjusri!" said Wukong.

55
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:41,526
"This green lion is my pet," said the bodhisattva.

56
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:46,790
"The king of the Black Rooster Kingdom was cruel to someone many years ago.

57
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:50,116
So my lion came to Earth to punish him.

58
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:53,871
The king's punishment is over now."

59
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:58,948
The bodhisattva and the lion disappeared above the clouds.

60
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:03,667
That night the king of the Black Rooster Kingdom hosted a feast.

61
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:07,635
During the feast he turned to the Tang Monk.

62
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:09,831
"Thank you for your help.

63
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:15,738
I hope you will reach the Western Paradise very soon."

64
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,822
Weeks passed, and the travelers continued west.

65
00:04:20,823 --> 00:04:26,517
One day Wukong saw a mysterious red cloud over the mountains ahead.

66
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:30,240
"Stop walking," he said quietly.

67
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:33,701
"What's wrong?" asked the Tang Monk.

68
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:35,720
The red cloud disappeared.

69
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:38,694
Wukong shook his head.

70
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:43,354
"Nothing, Master. I thought I saw a red cloud."

71
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:46,478
They walked some more.

72
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,573
Wukong saw the red cloud again.

73
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:52,880
He held up his hand for the others to stop.

74
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:58,343
The red cloud disappeared once again, and Wukong started to walk again.

75
00:04:58,344 --> 00:05:01,619
But then the red cloud reappeared.

76
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,723
"Stop," said the monkey.

77
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:05,853
The Tang Monk groaned.

78
00:05:05,854 --> 00:05:13,650
"Wukong, should we keep going or not?"
